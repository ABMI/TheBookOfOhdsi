\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Goals of this book}

This book aims to be a central knowledge repository for OHDSI, and focuses on describing the OHDSI community, data standards, and tools. It is intended both for those new to OHDSI and veterans alike, and aims to be practical, providing the necessary theory and subsequent instructions on how to do things. After reading this book you will understand what OHDSI is, and how you can join the journey. You will learn what the common data model and standard vocabularies are, and how they can be used to standard an observational healthcare database. You will learn there are three main uses cases for these data: characterization, population-level estimation, and patient-level prediction, and that all three activities are supported by OHDSI's open source tools, and how to use them. You will learn how to establish the quality of the generated evidence through data quality, clinical validity, software validity, and method validity. Lastly, you will learn how these tools can be used to execute these studies in a distributed research network.

\hypertarget{OpenScience}{%
\chapter{Open Science}\label{OpenScience}}

\emph{Chapter lead: Kees van Bochove}

From the inception of the OHDSI community, the goal was to establish an international collaborative by building on open science values, such as the use of open source software, public availability of all conference proceedings and materials, and transparent, open access publication of generated medical evidence. But what exactly is open science? And how could OHDSI build an open science or open data strategy around medical data, which is very privacy sensitive and typically not open at all for good reasons? Why is it so important to have reproducibility of analysis, and how does the OHDSI community aim to achieve this? These are some of the questions that we touch on in this chapter.

\hypertarget{open-science}{%
\section{Open Science}\label{open-science}}

The term `open science' has been used since the nineties, but really gained traction in the 2010s, during the same period OHDSI was born. Wikipedia \citep{wiki:Open_science} defines it as ``the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional'', and goes on to state that it is typically developed through collaborative networks. Although the OHDSI community never positioned itself explicitly as an `open science' collective or network, the term is frequently used to explain the driving concepts and principles behind OHDSI. For example, in 2015, Jon Duke presented OHDSI as ``An Open Science Approach to Medical Evidence Generation''\footnote{\url{https://www.ohdsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ARM-OHDSI_Duke.pdf}}, and in 2019, the EHDEN projects' introductory webinar hailed the OHDSI network approach as ``21st Century Real World Open Science''\footnote{\url{https://www.ehden.eu/webinars/}}. Indeed, as we shall see in this chapter, many of the practices of open science can be found in today's OHDSI community. One could argue that the OHDSI community is a grassroots open science collective driven by a shared desire for improving the transparency and reliability of medical evidence generation.

Open science or ``Science 2.0'' \citep{wiki:Science_2.0} approaches mean to address a number of perceived problems within the current scientific practice. Information technology has led to an explosion of data generation and analysis methods, and for individual researchers, it is very hard to keep up with all literature published in their area of expertise. This holds even more true for medical doctors who have a practice to run as day job, but still need to keep abreast of the latest medical evidence. In addition, there is growing concern that many experiments may suffer from poor statistical designs, publication bias, p-hacking and similar statistical problems, and are hard to reproduce. The traditional method of correcting these problems, peer review of published articles, often fails to identify and tackle these problems. The special 2018 Nature edition on ``Challenges in irreproducible research''\footnote{\url{https://www.nature.com/collections/prbfkwmwvz}} includes several examples of this. A group of authors attempting to apply systematic peer review on the articles in their field found that, for various reasons, it was very hard to get the errors they identified rectified. Especially hard to correct are those experiments that have a flawed experimental design to begin with. In the words of Ronald Fisher: ``To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of.'' \citep{wikiquote:Ronald_Fisher} The authors encountered common statistical problems such as poor randomization designs leading to false conclusions about statistical significance, miscalculations in meta-analyses, and inappropriate baseline comparisons. \citep{allison_2016} Another paper from the same collection, taking experiences from physics as an example, argues that it is critical to not only provide access to the underlying data, but also to publish and properly document the data processing and analysis scripts to achieve full reproducibility. \citep{Chen2018}

The OHDSI community addresses these challenges in its own way, and puts significant emphasis on the importance of generating medical evidence at scale. As stated in \citet{schuemie_2018b}, while the current paradigm ``centers on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time'', the OHDSI community ``advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base.'' This is achieved by a combination of a network of medical data sources that map their data to the OMOP common data model, open source analytics code that can be used and verified by all, and large-scale baseline data such as the condition occurrences published at howoften.org. In the following paragraphs, concrete examples are provided and the open science approach of OHDSI is detailed further using the four principles of Open Standards, Open Source, Open Data and Open Discourse as a guide. The chapter is concluded with a brief reference to the FAIR principles and outlook for OHDSI from an open science perspective.

\hypertarget{open-science-in-action-the-study-a-thon}{%
\section{Open Science in Action: the Study-a-thon}\label{open-science-in-action-the-study-a-thon}}

A recent development in the community is the emergence of `study-a-thons': short, concentrated face to face gatherings of a multidisciplinary group of scientists aimed at answering an important clinically relevant research question using the OMOP data model and the OHDSI tools. A nice example is the 2018 Oxford study-a-thon, which is explained in an EHDEN webinar (\url{https://youtu.be/X5yuoJoL6xs}) which provides a walkthrough of the process and also highlights the openly available results. In the period leading up to the study-a-thon, the participants propose medically relevant research questions to study, and one or more research questions are selected to study during the study-a-thon itself. Data is provided through participants that have access to patient-level data in OMOP format and are able to run queries on these data sources. Much of the actual study-a-thon time is devoted to discussing the statistical approach (see also the next chapter \ref{WhereToBegin}), the suitability of the data sources, the results which are interactively produced and the follow-up questions that are inevitably raised by these results. In the case of the Oxford study-a-thon, the questions centered around studying adverse post-surgical effects of different knee replacement methods, and the results were published interactively during the study-a-thon using the OHDSI forums and tools \ref{OhdsiAnalyticsTools}. \footnote{\url{https://forums.ohdsi.org/t/ohdsi-oxford-study-a-thon-any-data-partners-want-to-participate-this-week-in-two-studies-on-knee-replacement/5650}} The OHDSI tools such as ATLAS faciliate rapid creation, exchange, discussion and tests of cohort definitions \ref@(CohortDefinitions), which greatly speeds up the initial process of achieving consensus on problem definition and choice of methods. Thanks to the usage of the OMOP Common Data Model by the involved data sources and the availability of the OHDSI open source patient level prediction packages \ref{PatientLevelPrediction}, it was possible to create a a prediction model for 90-day post-operative mortality in one day, and validate the model externally in several large data sources the day after. The study-a-thon also resulted in a traditional peer-reviewed paper (Development and validation of patient-level prediction models for adverse outcomes following total knee arthroplasty, Ross Williams, Daniel Prieto-Alhambra et al., manuscript in preparation), which took of course months to process through peer review. But the fact that the analysis scripts and results for several healthcare databases covering hundreds of millions of patient records were conceived, produced and published from scratch within a week, illustrates the fundamental improvements OHDSI can bring to medical science, reducing the turnaround time for evidence to become available from months to days.

\hypertarget{open-standards}{%
\section{Open Standards}\label{open-standards}}

A very significant community resource that is maintained in the OHDSI community is the OMOP Common Data Model \ref{CommonDataModel} and associated Standardized Vocabularies \ref{StandardizedVocabularies}. The model itself is scoped to capture observational healthcare data, and was originally meant to analyze associations between exposures such as drugs, procedures, devices etc. and outcomes such as conditions and measurements, and is now extended for various analysis use cases (see also \ref{DataAnalyticsUseCases}). However, harmonizing healthcare data worldwide from a wide variety of coding systems, healthcare paradigm and different types of healthcare sources requires a massive amount of `mappings' between source codes and their closest standardized counterparts. The OMOP Standardized Vocabulary is further described in chapter 6 and includes mappings from hundreds of medical coding systems that are in used worldwide, and is browseable through the OHDSI Athena tool. By providing these vocabularies and mappings as a freely available community resource, OMOP and the OHDSI community make a significant contribution to healthcare data analytics and is by several accounts the most comprehensive model for this purpose, representing approximately 1.2 billion healthcare records worldwide \citep{garza_2016} \footnote{\url{https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/events/common-data-model-europe-why-which-how}}.

\hypertarget{open-source}{%
\section{Open Source}\label{open-source}}

Another key resource the OHDSI community provides are open source programs. These can be divided in several categories, such as the helper tools to map data to OMOP \ref{ExtractTransformLoad}, the OHDSI Methods Library which contain a powerful suite of commonly used statistical methods, open source code for published observational studies, and ATLAS, Athena and other infrastructure-related software which underpins the OHDSI ecosystem \ref{OhdsiAnalyticsTools}. See chapter 9 for a detailed overview.
From an open science perspective, one of the most important resources is the code for the actual execution of studies, such as studies from the OHDSI Research Network \ref{NetworkResearch}. In turn, these programs leverage the fully open source OHDSI stack, which can be inspected, reviewed and contributed to via GitHub. For example, network studies often build on the Methods Library, which ensures a consistent re-use of statistical methods across analytical use cases. See the \ref{SoftwareValidity} chapter for a more detailed overview of how the use of and collaboration on open source software in OHDSI ultimately underpins the quality and reliability of the generated evidence.

\hypertarget{open-data}{%
\section{Open Data}\label{open-data}}

Because of the privacy-sensitive nature of healthcare data, fully open comprehensive patient-level datasets are typically not available. However, it is possible to leverage OMOP mapped datasets to publish important aggregated data and results sets, such as the earlier mentioned howoften.org and other public result sets that are published to data.ohdsi.org. Also, the OHDSI community provides simulated datasets such as SynPUF for testing and development purposes, and the OHDSI Research Network \ref{NetworkResearch} can be leveraged to run studies in a network of available datasources that have mapped their data to OMOP. In order to make the mapping between the source data and the OMOP CDM transparent, it is encouraged for data sources to re-use the OHDSI ETL or `mapping' tools and publish their mapping code as open source as well.

\hypertarget{open-discourse}{%
\section{Open Discourse}\label{open-discourse}}

Open standards, open source and open data are great assets, but left by themselves, they will not impact medical practice. Key to the open science practice and impact of OHDSI is the implementation of medical evidence generation and the translation of the science to medical practice. The OHDSI community has now several annual OHDSI Symposia, in the United States and Europe, and dedicated communities of practice in a.o. China and Korea. These symposia discuss the advancements in statistical methods, data and software tooling, the standardized vocabularies, and all other aspects of the OHDSI open source community. The OHDSI forums \footnote{\url{https://forums.ohdsi.org}} and wiki \footnote{\url{https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki}} facilitate thousands of researchers worldwide in practicing observational research. The community calls \footnote{\url{https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:overview}} and the code, issues and pull requests in Github \footnote{\url{https://github.com/ohdsi}} constantly evolve the open community assets such as code and the CDM, and in the OHDSI Network Studies, global observational research is practiced in an open and transparent way using hundreds of millions of patient records worldwide. Openness and open discourse is encouraged throughout the community, and this very book is written via an open process facilitated by the OHDSI wiki, community calls and a GitHub repository \footnote{\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/TheBookOfOhdsi}}. It needs to be stressed however that without all the OHDSI collaborators, the processes and tools would be empty shells. Indeed, one could argue that the true value of the OHDSI community is with its members, who share a vision of improving health through collaborative and open science. \ref{MissionVisionValues}

\hypertarget{ohdsi-and-the-fair-guiding-principles}{%
\section{OHDSI and the FAIR Guiding Principles}\label{ohdsi-and-the-fair-guiding-principles}}

This last paragraph of the chapter takes a look at the current state of the OHDSI community and tooling, using the FAIR Data Guiding Principles published in \citet{wilkinson2016}.

\hypertarget{findability}{%
\subsection{Findability}\label{findability}}

Any healthcare database that is mapped to OMOP and used for analytics, should from a scientific perspective be persisted for future reference and reproducibility. The use of persistent identifiers for OMOP databases is not yet widespread, partly because these databases are often contained behind firewalls and on internal networks and not necessarily connected to the internet. However, it is of course entirely possible to publish summaries of the databases as a descriptor record that can be referenced for e.g.~citation purposes. This method is followed in for example the EMIF catalog \footnote{\url{https://emif-catalogue.eu}}, which provides a comprehensive record of the database in terms of data gathering purpose, sources, vocabularies and terms, access control mechanisms, license, consents etc. \citep{Oliveira2019} This approach is further developed in the IMI EHDEN project.

\hypertarget{accessibility}{%
\subsection{Accessibility}\label{accessibility}}

Accessibility of OMOP mapped data through an open protocol is typically achieved through the SQL interface, which combined with the OMOP CDM provides a standardized and well-documented method for accessing OMOP data. However, as discussed above, OMOP sources are often not directly available over the internet for security reasons. Creating a secure worldwide healthcare data network that is accessible for researchers is an active research topic and operational goal of projects like IMI EHDEN. However, what can be openly published are results of analyses in multiple OMOP databases, as shown through OHDSI initiatives such as LEGEND and howfoften.org.

\hypertarget{interoperability}{%
\subsection{Interoperability}\label{interoperability}}

Interoperability is arguably the strong suit of the OMOP data model and OHDSI tooling. In order to build a strong network of medical data sources worldwide which can be leveraged for evidence generation, achieving interoperability between healthcare data sources is key, and this is achieved through the OMOP model and Standardized Vocabularies. However, by sharing cohort definitions and statistical approaches, the OHDSI community goes beyond code mapping and also provides a platform to build an interoperable understanding of the analysis methods for healthcare data.
Since healthcare systems such as hospitals are often the source of record for OMOP data, the interoperability of the OHDSI approach could be further enhanced by alignment with operational healthcare interoperability standards such as HL7 FHIR, HL7 CIMI and openEHR. The same is true for alignment with clinical interoperability standards such as CDISC and biomedical ontologies. Especially in areas such as oncology, this is an important topic, and the Oncology Working Group and Clinica Trials Working Group in the OHDSI community provide good examples of forums where these issues are actively discussed.
In terms of references to other data and specifically ontology terms, ATLAS and OHDSI Athena are important tools, as they allow the exploration of the OMOP Standardized Vocabularies in the context of other available medical coding systems.

\hypertarget{reusability}{%
\subsection{Reusability}\label{reusability}}

The FAIR principles around reusability focus on important issues such as the data license, provenance (clarifying how the data came in existence) and the link to relevant community standards.
Data licensing is a complicated topic, especially across jurisdictions, and it would fall outside of the scope of this book to cover it extensively. However, it is important to state that if you intend for your data (e.g.~analysis results) to be freely used by others, it is good practice to explicitly provide these permissions via a data license. This is not yet a common practice for most data that can be found on internet, and the OHDSI community is unfortuantely not an exception here.
The data provenance of OMOP databases is a very interesting topic, as there are potential improvements for making these available in an automated way, provided the ETL and mapping tools would persist metadata about for example the used CDM version, Standardized Vocabularies release, custom code lists etc. The OHDSI ETL tools do not currently produce this information automatically, but working groups such as the Data Quality Working Group and Metadata Working Group actively work on these. Another important aspect is the provenance of the underlying databases itself, for example it is important to know if a hospital or GP information system was replaced or changed, and when known data omissions or other data issues occurred historically. Exploring ways to attach this metadata systematically in the OMOP CDM is the domain of the Metadata Working Group.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

To conclude, the OHDSI community itself can be seen as an open science community that is actively pursuing the interoperability and reproducibility of medical evidence generation. It also advocates a paradigm shift from single study and single estimate medical research to large-scale systematic evidence generation, where facts such as baseline occurrence are known and the evidence focuses on statistically estimating the effects of interventions and treatments from real world healthcare sources.

``A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.'' - Lao Tzu
\end{quote}

The OHDSI community represents a mosaic of stakeholders across academia, industry and government-entities. Our work benefits a range of individuals and organizations, including patients, providers, and researchers, as well as health care systems, industry, and government agencies. This benefit is achieved by improving both the quality of healthcare data analytics as well as the usefulness of healthcare data to these stakeholders. We believe observational research is a field which benefits greatly from disruptive thinking. We actively seek and encourage fresh methodological approaches in our work.

Everyone is welcome to actively participate in OHDSI, whether you are a patient, a health professional, a researcher, or someone who simply believes in our cause. OHDSI maintains an inclusive membership model. To become an OHDSI collaborator requires no membership fee. Collaboration is as simple as raising a hand to be included in the yearly OHDSI membership count. Involvement is entirely at-will. A collaborator can have any level of contribution within the community, ranging from someone who attends weekly community calls to leading network studies or OHDSI working groups. Collaborators do not have to be data holders to be considered active members of the community. The OHDSI community aims to serve data holders, researchers, health care providers and patients \& consumers alike. A record of collaborator profiles are maintained and periodically updated on the OHDSI website. Membership is fostered via OHDSI community calls, workgroups and regional chapters.

\hypertarget{ohdsi-community-calls}{%
\subsection{OHDSI Community Calls}\label{ohdsi-community-calls}}

OHDSI Community Calls are a weekly forum to spotlight ongoing activity within the OHDSI community. Held every Tuesday from 12-1pm ET, these teleconferences are a time for the OHDSI community to come together to share recent developments and recognize the accomplishments of individual collaborators, working groups and the community as a whole. Each week's meeting is recorded, and presentations are archived in the OHDSI website resources.

All OHDSI Collaborators are welcome to participate in this weekly teleconference and encouraged to propose topics for community discussion. OHDSI Community Calls can be a forum to share research findings, present and seek feedback for active works-in-progress, demonstrate open-source software tools under development, debate community best practices for data modeling and analytics, and brainstorm future collaborative opportunities for grants/publications/conference workshops. If you are a Collaborator with a topic for an upcoming OHDSI Collaborator meeting, you are invited to post your thoughts on the OHDSI Forums.

As a newcomer to the OHDSI community, it's highly encouraged to add this call to your calendar to get acquainted with what's happening across the OHDSI network. Newcomers are invited to introduce themselves on their first call and tell the community about themselves, their background and what brought them to OHDSI. If you'd like to join an OHDSI call, please contact Maura Beaton (\href{mailto:beaton@ohdsi.org}{\nolinkurl{beaton@ohdsi.org}}) for the latest dial-in details or consult the \href{https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:ohdsi_community}{OHDSI wiki}.

\section{Navigating Your Odyssey in OHDSI}\label{navigating-your-odyssey-in-ohdsi}}

As discussed in the previous section, there are many ways to begin your journey in the OHDSI community. Collaborators often find the journey from initial interest in OHDSI to actively contributing to be as circuitous as Homer's Odyssey. For those interested in running OHDSI research studies, the simplest way to navigate your path forward is to learn how to speak in ``OHDSI'' terms.

\hypertarget{how-to-translate-your-research-question-into-an-ohdsi-framework}{%
\subsection{How to Translate Your Research Question into an OHDSI Framework}\label{how-to-translate-your-research-question-into-an-ohdsi-framework}}

The OHDSI community has a wide range of standardized analytic tools depending on the type of question you are formulating. In the following chapters, we will discuss the intricacies of these frameworks as well as the open source tools and code available to conduct these analyses. In this section, we will briefly discuss how to take your question and reframe it in OHDSI-speak, what analytical methods and tools are appropriate for data analysis, and where you can find the resources within the OHDSI community.

\hypertarget{step-1-identify-the-proper-framework}{%
\subsubsection{Step 1: Identify the proper framework}\label{step-1-identify-the-proper-framework}}

Before formulating your research question for execution on OHDSI platform, it is important to understand which OHDSI framework suits the objectives of research question, whether it is a ``clinical characterization'', ``population-level estimation'', or ``patient-level prediction''. \protect\hyperlink{Characterization}{Characterization} provides answers to ``What happened to them'' questions, {[}PopulationLevelEstimation{]} responses to ``What are the causal effects'' questions, and {[}PatientLevelPrediction{]} answers ``What will happen to them'' questions. To learn more about the OHDSI use cases, please refer to Chapter \ref{DataAnalyticsUseCases}.

Once you understand the relationship between OHDSI framework and different study types you will be using, you can then further refine your question into OHDSI-speak. THere are examples of study categories that correspond to each OHDSI framework:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Clinical characterization}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Disease natural history
  \item
    Incidence rate
  \item
    Prevalence
  \item
    Treatment utilization
  \item
    Treatment pathway
  \item
    Quality improvement
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Population-level effect estimation}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Safety surveillance
  \item
    Effect estimation
  \item
    Comparative effectiveness
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Patient-level prediction}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Precision Medicine
  \item
    Disease onset and progression
  \item
    Treatment choice
  \item
    Disease interception
  \item
    Treatment response
  \item
    Treatment safety
  \item
    Treatment adherence
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Many people start with a simple characterization (e.g., how many people have angioedema? How often does a patient receive ACE inhibitors?). Even if you are thinking about an estimation or prediction question, you'll probably want to start with preliminary characterization analyses to understand your target and outcome cohorts. In fact, estimation and prediction studies produce characterization results as part of their standardized outputs.

The tool below also provides a crosswalk of the type of question with a desired output you may be formulating to what OHDSI framework may be most appropriate for that question.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  \item
    What is the risk of X on Y?
  \item
    What is the time-to-event of\ldots?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  And the desired output is:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Relative risk

    Odds ratio
  \item

    Causal effect
  \item
    Association
  \item
    Correlation
  \item
    Safety surveillance
  \item
    Comparative effectiveness
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Then you're probably asking for:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Population-level effect estimation}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If your question is:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What is the chance that this patient will\ldots?
  \item

\subsection{Example of a Study in OHDSI-speak}\label{example-of-a-study-in-ohdsi-speak}}

You're a researcher interested in studying the effects of ACE inhibitor monotherapy vs.~thiazide diuretic monotherapy on the outcomes of acute myocardial infarction and angioedema as first-line treatment for hypertension. You understand that based on the OHDSI literature, you are asking a population-level effect estimation question but first, you need to do some homework on how to characterize this particular treatment of interest.

\hypertarget{characterization-questions}{%
\subsubsection{Characterization Questions}\label{characterization-questions}}

Acute myocardial infarction is a cardiovascular complication that can occur in patients with high blood pressure, so effective treatment for hypertension should reduce the risk. Angioedema is a known side effect of ACE inhibitors, which is rare but potentially serious. You start by creating {[}Cohorts{]} for the exposures of interest (new users of ACE inhibitors and new users of thiazide diuretics). You perform a \protect\hyperlink{Characterization}{Characterization} analysis to summarize baseline characteristics of these exposure populations, including demographics, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications. You perform another characterization analysis to estimate the incidence of selected outcomes within these exposure populations. Here, you ask `how often does 1) acute myocardial infarction and 2) angioedema occur during the period of exposure to ACE inhibitors and thiazide diuretics?' These characterizations allow us to assess the feasibility of conducting a {[}PopulationLevelEstimation{]}, to evaluate whether the two treatment groups are comparable, and to identify `risk factors' that might predict which treatment choice that patients made.

\hypertarget{population-level-estimation-question}{%
\subsubsection{Population-Level Estimation Question}\label{population-level-estimation-question}}

The population-level effect estimation study estimates the relative risk of ACE inhibitor vs, thiazide use for the outcomes of AMI and angioedema. Here, you further evaluate through study diagnostics and negative controls whether we can produce a reliable estimate of the average treatment effect.

Independent of whether there is a causal effect of the exposures, you are also interested in trying to determine which patients are at highest risk of the outcomes. (This is a patient-level prediction problem). Here, you develop a prediction model that evaluates: amongst the patients who are new users of ACE inhibitors, which patients are at highest risk of developing acute myocardial infarction during the 1 year after starting treatment. The model allows us to predict, for a patient who has just been prescribed ACE for the first time, based on events observed from their medical history, what is the chance that they will experience AMI in the next 1 year.

No single observational data source provides a comprehensive view of the clinical data a patient accumulates while receiving healthcare, and therefore none can be sufficient to meet all expected outcome analysis needs. This explains the need for assessing and analyzing multiple data sources concurrently using a common data standard. This standard is provided by the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). In this chapter we provide an overview of the data model itself, design, conventions, and discussion of select tables.

The CDM is designed to support the conduct of research to identify and evaluate associations between interventions (drug exposure, procedures, healthcare policy changes etc.) and outcomes caused by these interventions (condition occurrences, procedures, drug exposure etc.). Outcomes can be efficacious (benefit) or adverse (safety risk). Often times, specific patient cohorts (e.g., those taking a certain drug or suffering from a certain disease) may be defined for treatments or outcomes, using clinical events (diagnoses, observations, procedures, etc.) that occur in predefined temporal relationships to each other. The CDM, combined with its standardized content (via the Standardized Vocabularies), will ensure that research methods can be systematically applied to produce meaningfully comparable and reproducible results.

An overview of all the tables in the CDM is provided in Figure \ref{fig:cdmDiagram}.

\section{Design Principles}\label{design-principles}}

The CDM is designed to include all observational health data elements (experiences of the patient receiving health care) that are relevant for analysis use cases to support the generation of reliable scientific evidence about disease natural history, healthcare delivery, effects of medical interventions, the identification of demographic information, health care interventions and outcomes.

Therefore, the CDM is designed to store observational data to allow for research, under the following principles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Suitability for purpose}: The CDM aims to provide data organized in a way optimal for analysis, rather than for the purpose of addressing the operational needs of health care providers or payers.
\item
  \textbf{Data protection}: All data that might jeopardize the identity and protection of patients, such as names, precise birthdays etc. are limited. Exceptions are possible where the research expressly requires more detailed information, such as precise birth dates for the study of infants.
\item
  \textbf{Design of domains}: The domains are modeled in a person-centric relational data model, where for each record the identity of the person and a date is captured as a minimum. Here, a relational data model is one where the data is represented as a collection of tables linked by primary and foreign keys.
\item
  \textbf{Rationale for domains}: Domains are identified and separately defined in an entity-relationship model if they have an analysis use case (conditions, for example) and the domain has specific attributes that are not otherwise applicable. All other data can be preserved as an observation in the observation table in an entity-attribute-value structure.
\item
  \textbf{Standardized Vocabularies}: To standardize the content of those records, the CDM relies on the Standardized Vocabularies containing all necessary and appropriate corresponding standard healthcare concepts.
\item
  \textbf{Reuse of existing vocabularies}: If possible, these concepts are leveraged from national or industry standardization or vocabulary definition organizations or initiatives, such as the National Library of Medicine, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, etc.
\item
  \textbf{Maintaining source codes}: Even though all codes are mapped to the Standardized Vocabularies, the model also stores the original source code to ensure no information is lost.
\item
  \textbf{Technology neutrality}: The CDM does not require a specific technology. It can be realized in any relational database, such as Oracle, SQL Server etc., or as SAS analytical datasets.
\item
  \textbf{Scalability}: The CDM is optimized for data processing and computational analysis to accommodate data sources that vary in size, including databases with up to hundreds of millions of persons and billions of clinical observations.
\item
  \textbf{Backwards compatibility}: All changes from previous CDMs are clearly delineated in the github repository \href{https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel}{(https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel)}. Older versions of the CDM can be easily created from the current version, and no information is lost that was present previously.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{data-model-conventions}{%
\section{Data Model Conventions}\label{data-model-conventions}}

There are a number of implicit and explicit conventions that have been adopted in the CDM. Developers of methods that run against the CDM need to understand these conventions.

\hypertarget{model-conv}{%
\subsection{General conventions of the model}\label{model-conv}}

The OMOP CDM is considered a ``person-centric'' model, meaning that the people (or patients) drive the event and observation tables. At a minimum, the tables have a foreign key into the PERSON table and a date. This allows for a longitudinal view on all healthcare-relevant events by person. The exceptions from this rule are the standardized health system data tables, which are linked directly to events of the various domains.

\hypertarget{general-conventions-of-schemas}{%
\subsection{General conventions of schemas}\label{general-conventions-of-schemas}}

New to CDM v6.0 is the concept of schemas. This allows for more separation between read-only and writeable tables. The clinical data, event, and vocabulary tables are in the ``CDM'' schema and are considered read-only to the end user. This means that the tables can be queried but no information can be accidentally removed or written over except by the database administrator. Tables that need to be manipulated by web-based tools or end users have moved to the ``Results'' schema. Currently the only two tables in the ``Results'' schema are COHORT and COHORT\_DEFINITON, though likely more will be added over the course of v6.0 point releases. The COHORT and COHORT\_DEFINITION tables are meant to describe groups of interest that the user might define, as detailed in chapter \ref{Cohorts}. These tables can be written to, meaning that a cohort created in ATLAS or by a user can be stored in the COHORT table and accessed at a later date. This does mean that cohorts in the COHORT table can be manipulated by anyone so it is always recommended that the SQL code used to create the cohort be saved along with the project or analysis in the event it needs to be regenerated.

\hypertarget{general-conventions-of-data-tables}{%
\subsection{General conventions of data tables}\label{general-conventions-of-data-tables}}

The CDM is platform-independent. Data types are defined generically using ANSI SQL data types (VARCHAR, INTEGER, FLOAT, DATE, DATETIME, CLOB). Precision is provided only for VARCHAR. It reflects the minimal required string length and can be expanded within a CDM instantiation. The CDM does not prescribe the date and datetime format. Standard queries against CDM may vary for local instantiations and date/datetime configurations.

In most cases, the first field in each table ends in "\_id", containing a record identifier that can be used as a foreign key in another table. For example, the CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table contains the field visit\_occurrence\_id which is a foreign key to the VISIT\_OCCURRENCE table where visit\_occurrence\_id is the primary key.

\emph{Note}: While the data model itself is platform independent, many of the tools that have been built to work with it require certain specifications. For more about this please see chapter \ref{OhdsiAnalyticsTools}

\hypertarget{general-conventions-of-domains}{%
\subsection{General conventions of domains}\label{general-conventions-of-domains}}

One of the ways in which the CDM is standardized is by the use of concept domains. Domains refer to the nature of a clinical entity and define the event table or field in an event table where a data record should be stored. This idea is covered fully in chapter \ref{StandardizedVocabularies} but it is important to the understanding of the data model that we touch on them here. All standard concepts in the OMOP vocabularies are organized into 30 domains, as shown in table \ref{tab:domains}. Domains, like concepts, are a major reason why every researcher who uses the OMOP CDM is considered to be ``speaking the same language''. Once source codes from a native database are mapped to standard concepts (see section \ref{concepts-sources}) the concepts themselves dictate which table they belong in by use of domains. In this way, a researcher using the CDM always knows where a record should be located rather than having to guess.

\hypertarget{representation-of-content-through-concepts}{%
\subsection{Representation of content through Concepts}\label{representation-of-content-through-concepts}}

In CDM data tables the content of each record is represented using Concepts. Concepts are stored in event tables with their concept IDs as foreign keys to the CONCEPT table, which contains concepts necessary to describe the healthcare experience of a patient. If a Standard Concept does not exist or cannot be identified, the concept ID 0 is used, representing a non-existing concept or un-mappable source value.

Records in the CONCEPT table contain detailed information about each concept (name, domain, class etc.). Concepts, Concept Relationships, Concept Ancestors and other information relating to Concepts is contained in the tables of the Standardized Vocabularies.

\hypertarget{concepts-sources}{%
\subsection{Difference between Concept IDs and Source Values}\label{concepts-sources}}

Many tables contain equivalent information in multiple places: As a Source Value, a Source Concept and as a Standard Concept.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Source Values} contain the codes from public code systems such as ICD-9-CM, NDC, CPT-4, READ etc. or locally controlled vocabularies (such as F for female and M for male) copied from the source data. Source Values are stored in the {[}entity{]}\_source\_value fields in the data tables.
\item
  \textbf{Concepts} are CDM-specific entities that represent the meaning of a clinical fact. Most concepts are based on code systems used in healthcare (called Source Concepts), while others were created de-novo (concept\_code = ``OMOP generated''). Concepts have unique IDs across all domains.
\item
  \textbf{Source Concepts} are the concepts that represent the code used in the source. Source Concepts are only used for common healthcare code systems, not for OMOP-generated Concepts. Source Concepts are stored in the {[}entity{]}\_source\_concept\_id field in the data tables.
\item
  \textbf{Standard Concepts} are those concepts that are used to define the unique meaning of a clinical entity. For each entity there is one Standard Concept. Standard Concepts are typically drawn from existing public vocabulary sources. Concepts that have the equivalent meaning to a Standard Concept are mapped to the Standard Concept. Standard Concepts are referred to in the {[}entity{]}\_concept\_id field of the data tables.
\end{itemize}

Source Values are only provided for convenience and quality assurance (QA) purposes. Source Values and Source Concepts are optional, while \textbf{Standard Concepts are mandatory}. Source Values may contain information that is only meaningful in the context of a specific data source. This mandatory use of Standard Concepts is what allows all OHDSI collaborators to speak the same language. For example, let's look at the condition ``Pulmonary Tuberculosis'' (TB). Figure \ref{fig:pulmTubICD9} shows that the ICD9CM code for TB is 011.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/CommonDataModel/pulmTubICD9} 

}

\caption{ICD9CM code for Pulmonary Tuberculosis}\label{fig:pulmTubICD9}
\end{figure}

Without the use of a standard way to represent TB the code 011 could be interpreted as ``Hospital Inpatient (Including Medicare Part A)'' in the UB04 vocabulary, or as ``Nervous System Neoplasms without Complications, Comorbidities'' in the DRG vocabulary. This is where Concept IDs, both Source and Standard, are valuable. The Concept ID that represents the 011 ICD9CM code is \href{http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/44828631}{44828631}. This differentiates the ICD9CM from the UBO4 and from the DRG. The Standard Concept that ICD9CM code maps to is \href{http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/253954}{253954} as shown in figure \ref{fig:pulmTubMap} by the relationship ``Non-standard to Standard map (OMOP)''. This same mapping relationship exists between Read, ICD10, CIEL, and MeSH codes, among others, so that any research that references the standard SNOMED concept is sure to include all supported source codes.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/CommonDataModel/pulmTubMap} \caption{SNOMED code for Pulmonary Tuberculosis}\label{fig:pulmTubMap}
\end{figure}

An example of how the standard concept-source code relationship is depicted in the tables is shown in Table \ref{tab:conditionOccurrence}.

\hypertarget{omop-cdm-standardized-tables}{%
\section{OMOP CDM Standardized Tables}\label{omop-cdm-standardized-tables}}

The OMOP CDM contains 16 Clinical data tables, 10 Vocabulary tables, 2 Metadata tables, 4 Health System data tables, 2 Health Economics data tables, 3 standardized derived elements, and 2 results schema tables. These tables are fully specified in the CDM Wiki\footnote{\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki}}.

To illustrate how these tables are used in practice the data of one person will be used as a common thread throughout the rest of the chapter. While part of the CDM the Vocabulary tables are not covered here, rather, they are detailed in depth in Chapter \ref{StandardizedVocabularies}.

\hypertarget{running-example-endometriosis}{%
\subsection{Running Example: Endometriosis}\label{running-example-endometriosis}}

Endometriosis is a painful condition whereby cells normally found in the lining of a woman's uterus occur elsewhere in the body. Severe cases can lead to infertility, bowel, and bladder problems. The following sections will detail one patient's experience with this disease and how her clinical experience might be represented in the Common Data Model.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/CommonDataModel/Lauren} \end{center}

\begin{quote}
Every step of this painfull journey I had to convince everyone how much pain I was in.
\end{quote}

Lauren had been experiencing endometriosis symptoms for many year; however, it took a ruptured cyst in her ovary before she was diagnosed. You can read more about Lauren at \url{https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/laurens-story}.

\hypertarget{person}{%
\subsection{PERSON table}\label{person}}

As the Common Data Model is a person-centric model (see section \ref{model-conv}) let's start with how she would be represented in the PERSON table.

\textbf{What do we know about Lauren?}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  She is a 36-year-old woman
\item
  Her birthday is 12-March-1982

  She is white

\hypertarget{observationPeriod}{%
\subsection{OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table}\label{observationPeriod}}

The OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table is designed to define the amount of time for which a patient's clinical events are recorded in the source system. For US healthcare insurance claims this is typically the enrollment period of the patient. When working with data from electronic health records (EHR) often the first record in the system is considered the observation\_period\_start\_date and the latest record is considered the observation\_period\_end\_date with the understanding that only the clinical events that happened within that particular system were recorded.

\textbf{How can we determine Lauren's observation period?}

Lauren's information as shown in Table \ref{tab:encounters} is most similar to EHR data in that we only have records of her encounters from which to determine her observation period.

\subsection{VISIT\_OCCURRENCE}\label{visitOccurrence}}

The VISIT\_OCCURRENCE table houses information about a patient's encounters with the health care system. Within the OHDSI vernacular these are referred to as visits and are considered to be discreet events. There are 12 categories of visits though the most common are inpatient, outpatient, emergency and long term care.

\textbf{How do we represent Lauren's encounters as visits?}

As an example let's represent the inpatient encounter in Table \ref{tab:encounters} as a record in the VISIT\_OCCURRENCE table.

\subsection{CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE}\label{conditionOccurrence}}

Records in the CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table are diagnoses, signs, or symptoms of a condition either observed by a Provider or reported by the patient.

\textbf{What are Lauren's conditions?}

Revisiting her account she says:

\begin{quote}
About 3 years ago I noticed my periods, which had also been painful, were getting increasingly more painful. I started becoming aware of a sharp jabbing pain right by my colon and feeling tender and bloated around my tailbone and lower pelvis area. My periods had become so painful that I was missing 1-2 days of work a month. Painkillers sometimes dulled the pain, but usually they didn't do much.

The SNOMED code for painful menstruation cramps, otherwise known as dysmenorrhea, is 266599000. Table \ref{tab:conditionOccurrence} shows how that would be represented in the CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table:

\hypertarget{drugExposure}{%
\subsection{DRUG\_EXPOSURE}\label{drugExposure}}

The DRUG\_EXPOSURE table captures records about the utilization of a drug when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body. Drugs include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as Drugs.

Drug exposures are inferred from clinical events associated with orders, prescriptions written, pharmacy dispensings, procedural administrations, and other patient-reported information.

\textbf{What are Lauren's drug exposures?}

We know that Lauren was given 60 acetaminophen 325mg oral tablets for 30 days (NDC code 69842087651) at her visit on 2010-01-06 to help with her dysmenorrhea pain. Here's how that might look in the DRUG\_EXPOSURE table:

\subsection{PROCEDURE\_OCCURRENCE}\label{procedureOccurrence}}

The PROCEDURE\_OCCURRENCE table contains records of activities or processes ordered by, or carried out by, a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose. Procedures are present in various data sources in different forms with varying levels of standardization. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Medical Claims include procedure codes that are submitted as part of a claim for health services rendered, including procedures performed.
\item
  Electronic Health Records that capture procedures as orders.
\end{itemize}

In order to get from the native/raw data to the OMOP CDM an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process has been designed and developed. This process consists of four major steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Data experts and CDM experts together design the ETL
\item
  People with medical knowledge create the code mappings
\item
  A technical person implements the ETL
\item
  All are involved in quality control
\end{enumerate}

There are tools available that have been developed by the community and this chapter will cover the steps in the process and the three tools available to facilitate those steps.

\textbf{Chapter Objectives:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Examine best practices around designing an ETL specification
\item
  Introduce community tools available for facilitating the ETL process
\item
  Discuss CDM and ETL maintenance
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{white-rabbit}{%
\subsection{White Rabbit}\label{white-rabbit}}

\textbf{Description}

To initiate an ETL process on a database you need to understand your data, including the tables, fields, and content. This is where the White Rabbit tool comes in; it scans your data and creates a report containing all the information necessary to begin writing ETL logic.

\textbf{Scope and Purpose}

WhiteRabbit's main function is to perform a scan of the source data, providing detailed information on the tables, fields, and values that appear in a field. The source data can be in comma-separated text files, or in a database (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft APS, Microsoft Access, Amazon RedShift). The resulting scan will generate a report that can be used as a reference when designing the ETL, for instance by using it in conjunction with the Rabbit-In-a-Hat tool. White Rabbit differs from standard data profiling tools in that it attempts to prevent the display of personally identifiable information (PII) data values in the generated output data file.

\textbf{Process Overview}

The typical sequence for using the software to scan source data in preparation of developing an ETL into an OMOP CDM:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Set working folder, the location on the local desktop computer where results will be exported.
\item
  Connect to the source database or CSV text file and test connection.
\item
  Select the tables of interest for the scan and scan the tables.
\item
  WhiteRabbit creates an export of information about the source data.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Installation and support}

All source code and installation instructions available on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit}

Additional information available on the OHDSI wiki: \url{http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:software:whiterabbit}

\textbf{Setting a Working Folder}

After downloading and installing the WhiteRabbit application, the first thing you need to do is set a working folder. Any files that WhiteRabbit creates will be exported to this local folder. Use the ``Pick Folder'' button to navigate in your local environment where you would like the scan document to go.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/ExtractTransformLoad/WhiteRabbitLocation} \caption{The "Pick Folder" button allows the specification of a working folder for the WhiteRabbit application}\label{fig:WhiteRabbitLocation}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Connection to a Database}

WhiteRabbit supports delimited text files, Oracle, Sql Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. More detailed information for how to connect can be found on the wiki.

\textbf{Scanning the Tables in a Database}

After connecting to a database, you can scan the tables contained therein. A scan generates a report containing information on the source data that can be used to help design the ETL. Using the Scan tab in WhiteRabbit you can either select individual tables in the selected source database by clicking on `Add' (Ctrl + mouse click), or automatically select all tables in the database by clicking on `Add all in DB'.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/ExtractTransformLoad/WhiteRabbitAddTables}

There are a few setting options as well with the scan:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Checking the `Scan field values' tells WhiteRabbit that you would like to investigate raw data items within tables selected for a scan (i.e.~if you select Table A, WhiteRabbit will review the contents in each column in Table A).
\item
  `Min cell count' is an option when scanning field values. By default this is set to 5, meaning values in the source data that appear less than 5 times will not appear in the report.
\item
  `Rows per table' is an option when scanning field values. By default, WhiteRabbit will random 1 million rows in the table. There are other options to review 100,000 or all rows within the table.
\item
  Unchecking the `Scan field values' tells WhiteRabbit to not review or report on any of the raw data items.
\item
  Once all settings are completed, press the ``Scan tables'' button. After the scan is completed the report will be written to the working folder.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/ExtractTransformLoad/WhiteRabbitScanSettings} \caption{WhiteRabbit scan settings}\label{fig:WhiteRabbitScanSettings}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Interpreting the Scan Report}

Once the scan is complete, an excel file is generated in the selected folder with one tab present for each table scanned as well as an overview tab. The overview tab lists all tables scanned, each field in each table, the data type of each field, the maximum length of the field, the number of rows in the table, the number of rows scanned, and how often each field was found to be empty.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/ExtractTransformLoad/ScanOverviewTab} \caption{Example overview tab from a scan report}\label{fig:ScanOverviewTab}
\end{figure}

The tabs for each of the tables, for example the conditions table in the raw\_synthea database, show each field, the values in each field, and the frequency of each value.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/ExtractTransformLoad/ScanConditionsTab} \caption{Example tab from a scan report}\label{fig:ScanConditionsTab}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{rabbit-in-a-hat}{%
\subsection{Rabbit-In-a-Hat}\label{rabbit-in-a-hat}}

Rabbit-In-a-Hat comes with WhiteRabbit and is designed to read and display a WhiteRabbit scan document. WhiteRabbit generates information about the source data while Rabbit-In-a-Hat uses that information and through a graphical user interface to allow a user to connect source data to tables and columns within the CDM. Rabbit-In-a-Hat generates documentation for the ETL process it does not generate code to create an ETL.

Similar to WhiteRabbit, installation information can be found on the github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/WhiteRabbit}} and information about the different options available in the application can be found on the wiki\footnote{\url{http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:software:whiterabbit}}.

\textbf{Writing ETL Logic}

Once you have opened your WhiteRabbit scan report in Rabbit-In-a-Hat you are ready to begin designing and writing the logic for how to convert the source data to the OMOP CDM. As an example, the next few sections will depict how some of the tables in the Synthea\textsuperscript{TM}\footnote{Synthea\textsuperscript{T}M is a patient generator that aims to model real patients. Data are created based on parameters passed to the application.The structure of the data can be found here: \url{https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki}.} database might look during conversion.

\textbf{General Flow of an ETL}

Since the OMOP CDM is a person-centric model it is always a good idea to start mapping the PERSON table first. Every clinical event table (CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE, DRUG\_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE\_OCCURRENCE, etc.) refers back to the PERSON table by way of the person\_id so working out the logic for the PERSON table first makes it easier later on. After the PERSON table a good rule of thumb is to convert the OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table next. Each person in a CDM database should have at least one OBSERVATION\_PERIOD and, generally, most events for a person fall within this timeframe. Once the PERSON and OBSERVATION\_PERIOD tables are done the dimensional tables like PROVIDER, CARE\_SITE, and LOCATION are typically next. The final table logic that should be worked out prior to the clincal tables is VISIT\_OCCURRENCE. Often this is the most complicated logic in the entire ETL and it is some of the most crucial since most events that occur during the course of a person's patient journey will happen during visits. Once those tables are finished it is your choice which CDM tables to map and in which order.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/ExtractTransformLoad/flowOfEtl} \caption{General flow of an ETL and which tables to map first}\label{fig:etlFlow}
\end{figure}

\emph{Note}

It is often the case that, during CDM conversion, you will need to make provisions for intermediate tables. This could be for assigning the correct visit\_occurrence\_ids to events, or for mapping source codes to standard concepts (doing this step on the fly is often very slow). This is 100\% allowed and encouraged. What is discouraged is the persistence and reliance on these tables once the conversion is complete.

\hypertarget{mapping-example-person-table}{%
\subsubsection{Mapping Example: Person table}\label{mapping-example-person-table}}

The Synthea data structure contains 20 columns in the patients table (\url{https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/CSV-File-Data-Dictionary\#patients}) but not all were needed to populate the PERSON table, as seen in figure \ref{fig:syntheaPerson}. This is very common and should not be cause for alarm. In this example many of the data points in the Synthea patients table that were not used in the CDM PERSON table were additional identifiers like patient name, driver's license number, and passport number.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/ExtractTransformLoad/syntheaPersonTable} \caption{Mapping of Synthea Patients table to CDM PERSON table.}\label{fig:syntheaPerson}
\end{figure}

The table below shows the logic that was imposed on the Synthea patients table to convert it to the CDM PERSON table. The `Comment field' column gives explanations for why the logic was chosen.

\section{ETL Step 2 - People with medical knowledge create the code mappings}\label{etl-step-2---people-with-medical-knowledge-create-the-code-mappings}}

Often the source data uses coding systems that are not in the OMOP Vocabulary. In this case, a mapping has to be created from the source coding system to one of the appropriate OMOP standard vocabularies (for example, for drugs the OMOP standard vocabulary is RxNorm, and for conditions it is SNOMED).

Mapping can be a daunting task, especially when there are many codes in the source coding system. (The Electronic Health Record (EHR), A Billing System or Scheduling System, Payor Claims Data) There are several things that can be done to make the task easier:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Focus on the most frequently used codes. A code that is never used or use maybe just once or twice is not worth the effort of mapping, since it will never be used in a real study. Pareto's 80/20 rule guides us to focus on the 20\% that make up 80\% of a given set. Hence, try to identify the the few codes that will provide high impact and coverage of your dataset.
\item
  Make use of existing information whenever possible. For example, many national drug coding systems have been mapped to ATC. Although ATC is not detailed enough for many purposes, the concept relationships between ATC and RxNorm can be used to make good guesses of what the right RxNorm codes are.
\item
  Use Usagi\footnote{\url{https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation:software:usagi}}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Usagi is a tool to aid the manual process of creating a code mapping. It can make suggested mappings based on textual similarity of code descriptions. If the source codes are only available in a foreign language, we have found that Google Translate often gives surprisingly good translation of the terms into English. Usagi allows the user to search for the appropriate target concepts if the automated suggestion is not correct. Finally, the user can indicate which mappings are approved to be used in the ETL.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{etl-step-3---a-technical-person-implements-the-etl}{%
\section{ETL Step 3 - A technical person implements the ETL}\label{etl-step-3---a-technical-person-implements-the-etl}}

Implementation usually varies site to site and it largely depends on many factors including infrastructure, size of the database, the complexity of the ETL, and the technical expertise available. A few examples of different ETLs:

\hypertarget{etl-step-4---all-are-involved-in-quality-control}{%
\section{ETL Step 4 - All are involved in quality control}\label{etl-step-4---all-are-involved-in-quality-control}}

For the extract, transform, load process, quality control is iterative. The typical pattern is to write logic -\textgreater{} implement logic -\textgreater{} test logic -\textgreater{} fix/write logic. There are different ways to approach data quality as detailed in chapter \ref{DataQuality} but we recommend at least the following steps in quality control:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Review of the ETL design document, computer code, and code mappings. Any one person can make mistakes, so always at least one other person should review what the first person did.
\item
  Manually compare all information on a sample of persons in the source and target data.
\item
  Compare overall counts in the source and target data.
\item
  Replicate a study that has already been performed on the source data on the CDM version.
\item
  Create unit tests meant to replicate a pattern in the source data that should be addressed in the ETL. For example, if your ETL specifies that patients without gender information should be dropped, create a unit test of a person without a gender and assess how the builder handles it.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{final-thoughts-on-etl}{%
\section{Final thoughts on ETL}\label{final-thoughts-on-etl}}

The ETL process is a difficult one to master for many reasons, not the least of which the fact that we are all working off of unique source data, making it hard to create a ``one-size-fits-all'' solution. However, there are some hard won lessons we have learned over the years.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The 80/20 rule. If you can avoid it don't spend too much time manually mapping source codes to concepts sets. Ideally, map the source codes that cover the majority of your data. This should be enough to get you started and you can address any remaining codes in the future based on use cases.
\item
  It's ok if you lose data that is not of research quality. Often these are the records that would be discarded before starting an analysis anyway, we just remove them during the ETL process instead.
\item
  A CDM requires maintenance. Just because you complete an ETL does not mean you don't need to touch it ever again. Your raw data might change, there might be a bug in the code, there may be new vocabulary or an update to the CDM. Plan for an allocate resources to these changes so your ETL is always up-to-date.

\hypertarget{DataAnalyticsUseCases}{%
\chapter{Data Analytics Use Cases}\label{DataAnalyticsUseCases}}

\emph{Chapter lead: David Madigan}

The OHDSI collaboration focuses on generating reliable evidence from real-world healthcare data, typically in the form of claims databases or electronic health record databases. The use cases that OHDSI focuses on fall into three major categories:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Characterization
\item
  Population-level estimation
\item
  Patient-level prediction
\end{itemize}

We describe these in detail below. Note, for all the use cases, the evidence we generate inherits the limitations of the data; we discuss these limitations at length in the book section on Evidence Quality (Chapters \ref{EvidenceQuality} - \ref{MethodValidity})

\hypertarget{characterization}{%
\section{Characterization}\label{characterization}}

Characterization attempts to answer the question

\begin{quote}
What happened to them?
\end{quote}

We can use the data to provide answers to questions about the characteristics of the persons in a cohort or the entire database, the practice of healthcare, and study how these things change over time.

The data can provide answers to questions like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, how many receive a prescription for warfarin?
\item
  What is the average age of patients who undergo hip arthroplasty?
\item
  What is the incidence rate of pneumonia in patients over 65 years old?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{population-level-estimation}{%
\section{Population-level estimation}\label{population-level-estimation}}

To a limited extent, the data can support causal inferences about the effects of healthcare interventions, answering the question

\begin{quote}
What are the causal effects?
\end{quote}

We would like to understand causal effects to understand consequences of actions. For example, if we decide to take some treatment, how does that change what happens to us in the future?

The data can provide answers to questions like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, in the first year after therapy initiation, does warfarin cause more major bleeds than dabigatran?
\item
  Does the causal effect of metformin on diarrhea vary by age?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{patient-level-prediction}{%
\section{Patient-Level prediction}\label{patient-level-prediction}}

Based on the collected patient health histories in the database, we can make patient-level predictions about future health events, answering the question

\begin{quote}
What will happen to me?
\end{quote}

The data can provide answers to questions like:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For a specific patient newly diagnosed with major depressive disorder, what is the probability the patient will attempt suicide in the first year following diagnosis?
\item
  For a specific patient newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, in the first year after therapy initiation with warfarin, what is the probability the patient suffers an ischemic stroke?
\end{itemize}

Population-level estimation and patient-level prediction overlap to a certain extent. For example, an important use case for prediction is to predict an outcome for a specific patient had drug A been prescribed and also predict the same outcome had drug B been prescribed. Let's assume that in reality only one of these drugs is prescribed (say drug A) so we get to see whether the outcome following treatment with A actually occurs. Since drug B was not prescribed, the outcome following treatment B, while predictable, is ``counterfactual'' since it is not ever observed. Each of these prediction tasks falls under patient-level prediction. However, the difference between (or ratio of) the two outcomes is a unit-level \emph{causal} effect, and should be estimated using causal effect estimation methods instead.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
People have a natural tendency to erroneously interpret predictive models as if they are causal models. But a predictive model can only show correlation, never causation. For example, diabetic drug use might be a strong predictor for myocardial infarction (MI) because diabetes is a strong risk factor for MI. However, that does not mean that stopping the diabetic drugs will prevent MI!
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

\hypertarget{limitations-of-observational-research}{%
\section{Limitations of observational research}\label{limitations-of-observational-research}}

There are many important healthcare questions for which OHDSI databases cannot provide answers. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Causal effects of interventions compared to placebo. Sometimes it is possible to consider the causal effect of a treatment as compared with non-treatment but not placebo treatment.
\item
  Anything related to over-the-counter medications.
\item
  Many outcomes and other variables are sparsely recorded if at all. These include mortality, behavioral outcomes, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status.
\item
  Since patients tend to encounter the healthcare system only when they are unwell, measurement of the benefits of treatments can prove elusive.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{missing-data}{%
\subsection{Missing data}\label{missing-data}}

Missingness in OHDSI databases presents subtle challenges. A health event (e.g., prescription, laboratory value, etc.) that should be recorded in a database, but isn't, is ``missing.'' The statistics literature distinguishes between types of missingness such as ``missing completely at random,'' ``missing at random'', and ``missing not at random'' and methods of increasing complexity attempt to address these types. \citet{perkins2017principled} provide a useful introduction to this topic.

\hypertarget{summary-3}{%

  In observational research we distinguish three large categories of uses cases.

\hypertarget{OhdsiAnalyticsTools}{%
\chapter{OHDSI Analytics Tools}\label{OhdsiAnalyticsTools}}

\emph{Chapter leads: Martijn Schuemie \& Frank DeFalco}

OHDSI offers a wide range of open source tools to support various data-analytics use cases on observational patient-level data. What these tools have in common is that they can all interact with one or more databases using the Common Data Model (CDM). Furthermore, these tools standardize the analytics for various use cases; Rather than having to start from scratch, an analysis can be implemented by filling in standard templates. This makes performing analysis easier, and also improves reproducibility and transparency. For example, there appear to be a near-infinite number of ways to compute an incidence rate, but these can be specified in the OHDSI tools with a few choices, and anyone making those same choices will compute incidence rates the same way.

In this chapter we first describe various ways in which we can choose to implement an analysis, and what strategies the analysis can employ. We then review the various OHDSI tools and how they fit the various use cases.

\hypertarget{analysisImplementation}{%
\section{Analysis implementation}\label{analysisImplementation}}

Figure \ref{fig:implementations} shows the various ways in which we can choose to implement a study against a database using the CDM.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/implementations} 

}

\caption{Different ways to implement an analysis against data in the CDM.}\label{fig:implementations}
\end{figure}

We may choose to write our analysis as custom code, and not make use of any of the tools OHDSI has to offer. One could write a de novo analysis in R, SAS, or any other language. This provides the maximum flexibility, and may in fact be the only option if the specific analysis is not supported by any of our tools. However, this path requires a lot of technical skill, time, and effort, and as the analysis increases in complexity it becomes harder to avoid errors in the code.

An alternative is to develop the analysis in R, and make use of the packages in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}{OHDSI Methods Library}. At a minimum, one could use the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/SqlRender/}{SqlRender} and \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/}{DatabaseConnector} packages described in more detail in Chapter \ref{SqlAndR} that allow the same code to be executed on various database platforms, such as PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. Other packages such as \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortMethod/}{CohortMethod} and \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} offer R functions for advanced analytics against the CDM that can be called on in one's code. This still requires a lot of technical expertise, but by re-using the validated components of the Methods Library we can be more efficient and error-free than when using completely custom code.

The third approach relies on our interactive analysis platform \href{https://github.com/OHDSI/Atlas/wiki}{ATLAS}, a web-based tool that allows non-programmers to perform a wide range of analyses efficiently. ATLAS makes use of the Methods Libraries but provides a simple, point and click interface to design analyses and in many cases generate the necessary R code to run the analysis. The pace of development can vary between the Methods Libraries and ATLAS which can lead to limited options in the ATLAS interface where the underlying libraries have more flexibility.

ATLAS and the Methods Library are not independent. Some of the more complicated analytics that can be invoked in ATLAS are executed through calls to the packages in the Methods Library. Similarly, cohorts used in the Methods Library are often designed in ATLAS.

\hypertarget{analysis-strategy}{%
\section{Analysis strategy}\label{analysis-strategy}}

More or less independently of how we choose to implement our analysis is the strategy that our analytics takes in answering specific questions. Figure \ref{fig:strategies} highlights three strategies that are employed in OHDSI.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/strategies} 

}

\caption{Strategies for generating evidence for (clinical) questions.}\label{fig:strategies}
\end{figure}

The first strategy views every analysis as a single individual study. The analysis must be pre-specified in a protocol, implemented as code, executed against the data, after which the result can be compiled and interpreted. For every question, all steps must be repeated. An example of such an analysis is the OHDSI study into the risk of angioedema associated with levetiracetam compared with phenytoin. \citep{duke_2017} Here, a protocol was first written, analysis code using the OHDSI Methods Library was developed and executed across the OHDSI network, and results were compiled and disseminated in a journal publication.

The second strategy develops an application that allows users to answer a specific class of questions in real time or near-real time. Once the application has been developed, users can interactively define queries, submit them, and view the results. An example of this strategy is the cohort definition and generation tool in ATLAS. This tool allows users to specify cohort definitions of varying complexity, and execute the definition against a database to see how many people meet the various inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The third strategy similarly focuses on a class of questions, but then attempts to exhaustively generate all the evidence for the questions within the class. Users can then explore the evidence as needed through a variety of interfaces. One example is the OHDSI study into the effects of depression treatments \citep{schuemie_2018b}. In this study all depression treatments are compared for a large set of outcomes of interest across four large observational databases. The full set of results, including 17,718 empirically calibrated hazard ratios along with extensive study diagnostics, is available in an interactive web app \footnote{\url{http://data.ohdsi.org/SystematicEvidence/}}.

\hypertarget{atlas}{%
\section{ATLAS}\label{atlas}}

ATLAS is a free, publicaly available, web-based tool developed by the OHDSI community that facilitates the design and execution of analyses on standardized, patient-level, observational data in the CDM format. ATLAS is deployed as a web application in combination with the OHDSI WebAPI and is typically hosted on Apache Tomcat. Performing real time analyses requires access to the patient-level data in the CDM and is therefore typically installed behind an organization's firewall. However, there is also a public ATLAS \footnote{\url{http://www.ohdsi.org/web/atlas}}, and although this ATLAS instance only has access to a small simulated datasets, it can still be used for many purposes including testing and training. For example, it is possible to fully define an effect estimation or prediction study using the public instance of ATLAS, and automatically generate the R code for executing the study. That code can then be run in any environment with an available CDM without needing to install ATLAS and the WebAPI.

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Data Sources]
Data sources provides the capability review descriptive, standardized reporting for each of the data sources that you have configured within your Atlas platform. This feature uses the large-scale analytics strategy: all descriptives have been pre-computed. Data sources is discussed in Chapter \ref{Characterization}.
\item[Vocabulary Search]
Atlas provides the ability to search and explore the OMOP standardized vocabulary to understand what concepts exist within those vocabularies and how to apply those concepts in your standardized analysis against your data sources. This feature is discussed in Chapter \ref{StandardizedVocabularies}.
\item[Concept Sets]
Concept sets provides the ability to create collections of logical expressions that can be used to identify a set of concepts to be used throughout your standardized analyses. Concept sets provide more sophistication than a simple list of codes or values. A concept set is comprised of multiple concepts from the standardized vocabulary in combination with logical indicators that allow a user to specify that they are interested in including or excluding related concepts in the vocabulary hierarchy. Searching the vocabulary, identifying the set of concepts, and specifying the logic to be used to resolve a concept set provides a powerful mechanism for defining the often obscure medical language used in analysis plans. These concept sets can be saved within ATLAS and then used throughout your analysis as part of cohort definitions or analysis specifications.
\item[Cohort Definitions]
Cohort definitions is the ability to construct a set of persons who satisfy one or more criteria for a duration of time and these cohorts can then serve as the basis of inputs for all of your subsequent analyses. This feature is discussed in Chapter \ref{Cohorts}.
\item[Characterizations]
Characterizations is an analytic capability that allows you to look at one or more cohorts that you've defined and to summarize characteristics about those patient populations. This feature uses the real-time query strategy, and is discussed in Chapter \ref{Characterization}.
\item[Cohort Pathways]
Cohort pathways is an analytic tool that allows you to look at the sequence of clinical events that occur within one or more populations. This feature uses the real-time query strategy, and is discussed in Chapter \ref{Characterization}.
\item[Incidence Rates]
Incidence rates is a tool that allows you to estimate the incidence of outcomes within target populations of interest. This feature uses the real-time query strategy, and is discussed in Chapter \ref{Characterization}.
\item[Profiles]
Profiles is a tool that allows you to explore an individual patients longitudinal observational data to summarize what is going on within a given individual. This feature uses the real-time query strategy.
\item[Population Level Estimation]
Estimation is a capability to allow you to define a population level effect estimation study using a comparative cohort design whereby comparisons between one or more target and comparator cohorts can be explored for a series of outcomes. This feature can be said to implement the real-time query strategy, as no coding is required, and is discussed in Chapter \ref{PopulationLevelEstimation}.
\item[Patient Level Prediction]
Prediction is a capability to allow you to apply machine learning algorithms to conduct patient level prediction analyses whereby you can predict an outcome within any given target exposures. This feature can be said to implement the real-time query strategy, as no coding is required, and is discussed in Chapter \ref{PatientLevelPrediction}.

\hypertarget{security}{%
\subsection{Security}\label{security}}

ATLAS and the WebAPI provide a granular security model to control access to features or data sources within the overall platform. The security system is built leveraging the Apache Shiro library. Additional information on the security system can be found in the online \href{https://github.com/OHDSI/WebAPI/wiki/Security-Configuration}{WebAPI security wiki}.

\subsection{Documentation}\label{documentation}}

Documentation for ATLAS can be found online in the \href{https://github.com/OHDSI/ATLAS/wiki}{ATLAS Github repository wiki}. This wiki includes information on the various application features as well as links to online video tutorials.

\hypertarget{how-to-install}{%
\subsection{How to install}\label{how-to-install}}

Installation of ATLAS is done in combination with the OHDSI WebAPI. Installation guides for each component are available online in the \href{https://github.com/OHDSI/Atlas/wiki/Atlas-Setup-Guide}{ATLAS Github repository Setup Guide} and \href{https://github.com/OHDSI/WebAPI/wiki/WebAPI-Installation-Guide}{WebAPI Github repository Installation Guide}.

\hypertarget{methods-library}{%
\section{Methods Library}\label{methods-library}}

The \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}{OHDSI Methods Library} is the collection of open source R packages show in Figure \ref{fig:methodsLibrary}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/methodsLibrary} 

}

\caption{Packages in the OHDSI Methods Library.}\label{fig:methodsLibrary}
\end{figure}

The packages offer R functions that together can be used to perform an observation study from data to estimates and supporting statistics, figures, and tables. The packages interact directly with observational data in the CDM, and can be used simply to provide cross-platform compatibility to completely custom analyses as described in Chapter \ref{SqlAndR}, or can provide advanced standardized analytics for population characterization (Chapter \ref{Characterization}), population-level causal effect estimation (Chapter \ref{PopulationLevelEstimation}), and patient-level prediction (Chapter \ref{PatientLevelPrediction}). The Methods Library supports best practices for use of observational data as learned from previous and ongoing research, such as transparency, reproducibility, as well as measuring of the operating characteristics of methods in a particular context and subsequent empirical calibration of estimates produced by the methods.

The Methods Library has already been used in many published clinical studies \citep{boland_2017, duke_2017, ramcharran_2017, weinstein_2017, wang_2017, ryan_2017, ryan_2018, vashisht_2018, yuan_2018, johnston_2019}, as well as methodological studies \citep{schuemie_2014, schuemie_2016, reps2018, tian_2018, schuemie_2018, schuemie_2018b, reps_2019}. Great care is taken to ensure the validity of the Methods Library, as described in Chapter \ref{SoftwareValidity}.

\hypertarget{support-for-large-scale-analytics}{%
\subsection{Support for large-scale analytics}\label{support-for-large-scale-analytics}}

One key feature incorporated in all packages is the ability to efficiently run many analyses. For example, when performing population-level estimation, the CohortMethod package allows for computing effect-size estimates for many exposures and outcomes, using various analysis settings, and the package will automatically choose the optimal path to compute all the required artifacts. Steps that can be re-used, such as extraction of covariates, or fitting a propensity model, will be executed only once. Where possible, computations will take place in parallel to maximize the use of computational resources.

This feature allows for large-scale analytics, answering many questions at once, and is also essential for including control hypotheses (e.g.~negative controls) to measure the operating characteristics of our methods, and perform empirical calibration as described in Chapter \ref{MethodValidity}.

\hypertarget{BigDataSupport}{%
\subsection{Support for big data}\label{BigDataSupport}}

The Methods Library is also designed to run against very large databases and be able to perform computations involving large amounts of data. This achieved in three ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Most data manipulation is performed on the database server. An analysis usually only requires a small fraction of the entire data in the database, and the Methods Library, through the SqlRender and DatabaseConnector packages, allows for advanced operations to be performed on the server to preprocess and extract the relevant data.
\item
  Large local data objects are stored in a memory-efficient manner. For the data that is downloaded to the local machine, the Methods Library uses the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ff}{ff} package to store and work with large data objects. This allows us to work with data much larger than fits in memory.
\item
  High-performance computing is applied where needed. For example, the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/Cyclops/}{Cyclops} package implements a highly efficient regression engine that is used throughout the Methods Library to perform large-scale regressions (large number of variables, large number of observations) that would not be possible to fit otherwise.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{documentation-1}{%
\subsection{Documentation}\label{documentation-1}}

R provides a standard way of documenting package. Each package has a \emph{package manual} that documents every function and data set in the package. All package manuals are available online through the Methods Library website \footnote{\url{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary}}, through the package GitHub repositories, and for those packages available through CRAN they can be found in CRAN. Furthermore, from within R the package manual can be consulted by using the question mark. For example, after loading the DatabaseConnector package, typing the command \texttt{?connect} brings up the documentation on the ``connect'' function.

In addition to the package manual, many packages provide \emph{vignettes}. Vignettes are long-form documentation that describe how a package can be used to perform certain tasks. For example, one vignette \footnote{\url{https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortMethod/articles/MultipleAnalyses.html}} describes how to perform multiple analyses efficiently using the CohortMethod package. Vignettes can also be found through the Methods Library website , through the package GitHub repositories, and for those packages available through CRAN they can be found in CRAN.

\hypertarget{system-requirements}{%
\subsection{System requirements}\label{system-requirements}}

Two computing environments are relevant when discussing the system requirements: The database server, and the analytics workstation.

The database server must hold the observational healthcare data in CDM format. The Methods Library supports a wide array of database management systems including traditional database systems (PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle), parallel data warehouses (Microsoft APS, IBM Netezza, and Amazon RedShift), as well as Big Data platforms (Hadoop through Impala, and Google BigQuery).

The analytics workstation is where the Methods Library is installed and run. This can either be a local machine, such as someone's laptop, or a remote server running RStudio Server. In all cases the requirements are that R is installed, preferably together with RStudio. The Methods Library also requires that Java is installed. The analytics workstation should also be able to connect to the database server, specifically, any firewall between them should have the database server access ports opened the the workstation. Some of the analytics can be computationally intensive, so having multiple processing cores and ample memory can help speed up the analyses. We recommend having at least four cores and 16 gigabytes of memory.

\hypertarget{installR}{%
\subsection{How to install}\label{installR}}

Here are the steps for installing the required environment to run the OHDSI R packages. Four things needs to be installed:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{R} is a statistical computing environment. It comes with a basic user interface that is primarily a command-line interface.
\item
  \textbf{RTools} is a set of programs that is required on Windows to build R packages from source.
\item
  \textbf{RStudio} is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that makes R easier to use. It includes a code editor, debugging and visualization tools. Please use it to obtain a nice R experience.
\item
  \textbf{Java} is a computing environment that is needed to run some of the components in the OHDSI R packages, for example those needed to connect to a database.
\end{enumerate}

Below we describe how to install each of these in a Windows environment.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
In Windows, both R and Java come in 32-bit and 64-bits architectures. If you install R in both architectures, you \textbf{must} also install Java in both architectures. It is recommended to only install the 64-bit version of R.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

\textbf{Installing R}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}, click on ``Download R for Windows'', then ``base'', then click the Download link indicated in Figure \ref{fig:downloadR}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/downloadR} 

}

\caption{Downloading R from CRAN.}\label{fig:downloadR}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  After the download has completed, run the installer. Use the default options everywhere, with two exceptions: First, it is better not to install into program files. Instead, just make R a subfolder of your C drive as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rDestination}. Second, to avoid problems due to differing architectures between R and Java, disable the 32-bit architecture as shown in Figure \ref{fig:no32Bits}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/rDestination} 

}

\caption{Settings the destination folder for R.}\label{fig:rDestination}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/no32Bits} 

}

\caption{Disabling the 32-bit version of R.}\label{fig:no32Bits}
\end{figure}

Once completed, you should be able to select R from your Start Menu.

\textbf{Installing RTools}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go to \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}, click on ``Download R for Windows'', then ``Rtools'', and select the very latest version of RTools to download.
\item
  After downloading has completed run the installer. Select the default options everywhere.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Installing RStudio}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to \url{https://www.rstudio.com/}, select ``Download RStudio'' (or the ``Download'' button under ``RStudio''), opt for the free version, and download the installer for Windows as shown in Figure \ref{fig:downloadRStudio}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/downloadRStudio} 

}

\caption{Downloading RStudio.}\label{fig:downloadRStudio}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  After downloading, start the installer, and use the default options everywhere.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Installing Java}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to \url{https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp}, and select the Windows 64-bit installer as shown in Figure \ref{fig:downloadJava}. If you also installed the 32-bit version of R, you \emph{must} also install the other (32-bit) version of Java.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/downloadJava} 

}

\caption{Downloading Java.}\label{fig:downloadJava}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  After downloading just run the installer.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Verifying the installation}

You should now be ready to go, but we should make sure. Start RStudio, and type

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"SqlRender"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(SqlRender)}
\KeywordTok{translate}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"SELECT TOP 10 * FROM person;"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"postgresql"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT  * FROM person LIMIT 10;"
\end{verbatim}

This function uses Java, so if all goes well we know both R and Java have been installed correctly!

Another test is to see if source packages can be built. Run the following R code to install the \texttt{CohortMethod} package from the OHDSI GitHub repository:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"drat"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{drat}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{addRepo}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"OHDSI"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"CohortMethod"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{deployment-strategies}{%
\section{Deployment strategies}\label{deployment-strategies}}

Deploying the entire OHDSI tool stack, including ATLAS and the Methods Library, in an organization is a daunting task. There are many components with dependencies that have to be considered, and configurations to set. For this reason, two initiatives have developed integrated deployment strategies that allow the entire stack to be installed as one package, using some forms of virtualization: Broadsea and Amazon Web Services (AWS).

\hypertarget{broadsea}{%
\subsection{Broadsea}\label{broadsea}}

BroadSea\footnote{\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/Broadsea}} uses Docker container technology\footnote{\url{https://www.docker.com/}}. The OHDSI tools are packaged along with dependencies into a single portable binary file called a Docker Image. This image can then be run on a Docker engine service, creating a virtual machine with all the software installed and ready to run. Docker engines are available for most operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The Broadsea Docker image contains the main OHDSI tools, including the Methods Library and ATLAS.

\hypertarget{amazon-aws}{%
\subsection{Amazon AWS}\label{amazon-aws}}

Amazon has prepared two environments that can be instantiated in the AWS cloud computing environment with a click of the button: OHDSI-in-a-Box\footnote{\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/OHDSI-in-a-Box}} and OHDSIonAWS\footnote{\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/OHDSIonAWS}}.

OHDSI-in-a-Box is specifically created as a learning environment, and is used in most of the tutorials provided by the OHDSI community. It includes many OHDSI tools, sample data sets, RStudio and other supporting software in a single, low cost Windows virtual machine. A PostgreSQL database is used to store the CDM and also to store the intermediary results from ATLAS. The OMOP CDM data mapping and ETL tools are also included in OHDSI-in-a-Box. The architecture for OHDSI-in-a-Box is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ohdsiinaboxDiagram}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/OhdsiAnalyticsTools/OHDSI-in-a-BoxDiagram} 

}

\caption{The Amazon Web Services architecure for OHDSI-in-a-Box.}\label{fig:ohdsiinaboxDiagram}
\end{figure}

OHDSIonAWS is a reference architecture for enterprise class, multi-user, scalable and fault tolerant OHDSI environments that can be used by organizations to perform their data analytics. It includes several sample datasets and can also automatically load your organization's real healthcare data. The data is placed in the Amazon Redshift database platform, which is supported by the OHDSI tools. Intermediary results of ATLAS are stored in a PostgreSQL database. On the front end, users have access to ATLAS and to RStudio through a web interface (leveraging RStudio Server). In RStudio the OHDSI Methods Library has already been installed, and can be used to connect to the databases. The automation to deploy OHDSIonAWS is open-source, and can be customized to include your organization's management tools and best practices. The architecture for OHDSIonAWS is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ohdsionawsDiagram}.

\hypertarget{SqlAndR}{%
\chapter{SQL and R}\label{SqlAndR}}

\emph{Chapter leads: Martijn Schuemie \& Peter Rijnbeek}

The Common Data Model (CDM) is a relational database model (all data is represented as records in tables that have fields), which means that the data will typically be stored in a relational database using a software platform like PostgreSQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server. The various OHDSI tools such as ATLAS and the Methods Library work by querying the database behind the scene, but we can also query the database directly ourselves if we have appropriate access rights. The main reason to do this is to perform analyses that currently are not supported by any existing tool. However, directly querying the database also comes with greater risk of making mistakes, as the OHDSI tools are often designed to help guide the user to appropriate analysis of the data, and direct queries do not provide such guidance.

The standard language for querying relational databases is SQL (Structured Query Language), which can be used both to query the database as well as to make changes to the data. Although the basic commands in SQL are indeed standard, meaning the same across software platforms, each platform has its own dialect, with subtle changes. For example, to retrieve the top 10 rows of the PERSON table on SQL Server one would type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ TOP }\DecValTok{10} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ person;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Whereas the same query on PostgreSQL would be:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ person }\KeywordTok{LIMIT} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In OHDSI, we would like to be agnostic to the specific dialect a platform uses; We would like to `speak' the same SQL language across all OHDSI databases. For this reason OHDSI developed the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/SqlRender/}{SqlRender} package, an R package that can translate from one standard dialect to any of the supported dialects that will be discussed later in this chapter. This standard dialect - \textbf{OHDSI SQL} - is mainly a subset of the SQL Server SQL dialect. The example SQL statements provided throughout this chapter will all use OHDSI SQL.

Each database platform also comes with its own software tools for querying the database using SQL. In OHDSI we developed the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/}{DatabaseConnector} package, one R package that can connect to many database platforms. DatabaseConnector will also be discussed later in this chapter.

So although one can query a database that conforms to the CDM without using any OHDSI tools, the recommended path is to use the DatabaseConnector and SqlRender packages. This allows queries that are developed at one site to be used at any other site without modification. R itself also immediately provides features to further analyse the data extracted from the database, such as performing statistical analyses and generating (interactive) plots.

In this chapter we assume the reader has a basic understanding of SQL. We first review how to use SqlRender and DatabaseConnector. If the reader does not intend to use these packages these sections can be skipped. In Section \ref{QueryTheCdm} we discuss how to use SQL (in this case OHDSI SQL) to query the CDM. The following section highlight how to use the OHDSI Standardized Vocabulary when querying the CDM. We highlight the QueryLibrary, a collection of commonly-used queries against the CDM that is publicly available. We close this chapter with an example study estimating incidence rates, and implement this study using SqlRender and DatabaseConnector.

\hypertarget{SqlRender}{%
\section{SqlRender}\label{SqlRender}}

The \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/SqlRender/}{SqlRender} package is available on CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network), and can therefore be installed using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"SqlRender"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

SqlRender supports a wide array of technical platforms including traditional database systems (PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and Oracle), parallel data warehouses (Microsoft APS, IBM Netezza, and Amazon RedShift), as well as Big Data platforms (Hadoop through Impala, and Google BigQuery). The R package comes with a package manual and a vignette that explores the full functionality. Here we describer some of the main features.

\hypertarget{sql-parameterization}{%
\subsection{SQL parameterization}\label{sql-parameterization}}

One of the functions of the package is to support parameterization of SQL. Often, small variations of SQL need to be generated based on some parameters. SqlRender offers a simple markup syntax inside the SQL code to allow parameterization. Rendering the SQL based on parameter values is done using the \texttt{render()} function.

\textbf{Substituting parameter values}

The \texttt{@} character can be used to indicate parameter names that need to be exchange for actual parameter values when rendering. In the following example, a variable called \texttt{a} is mentioned in the SQL. In the call to the render function the value of this parameter is defined:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT * FROM concept WHERE concept_id = @a;"}
\KeywordTok{render}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{a =} \DecValTok{123}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM concept WHERE concept_id = 123;"
\end{verbatim}

Note that, unlike the parameterization offered by most database management systems, it is just as easy to parameterize table or field names as values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT * FROM @x WHERE person_id = @a;"}
\KeywordTok{render}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{x =} \StringTok{"observation"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{a =} \DecValTok{123}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM observation WHERE person_id = 123;"
\end{verbatim}

The parameter values can be numbers, strings, booleans, as well as vectors, which are converted to comma-delimited lists:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT * FROM concept WHERE concept_id IN (@a);"}
\KeywordTok{render}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{a =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{123}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{234}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{345}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM concept WHERE concept_id IN (123,234,345);"
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{If-then-else}

Sometimes blocks of codes need to be turned on or off based on the values of one or more parameters. This is done using the \texttt{\{Condition\}\ ?\ \{if\ true\}\ :\ \{if\ false\}} syntax. If the \emph{condition} evaluates to true or 1, the \emph{if true} block is used, else the \emph{if false} block is shown (if present).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT * FROM cohort \{@x\} ? \{WHERE subject_id = 1\}"}
\KeywordTok{render}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{x =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM cohort "
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{render}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{x =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM cohort WHERE subject_id = 1"
\end{verbatim}

Simple comparisons are also supported:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT * FROM cohort \{@x == 1\} ? \{WHERE subject_id = 1\};"}
\KeywordTok{render}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{x =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM cohort WHERE subject_id = 1;"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{render}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{x =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM cohort ;"
\end{verbatim}

As well as the \texttt{IN} operator:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT * FROM cohort \{@x IN (1,2,3)\} ? \{WHERE subject_id = 1\};"}
\KeywordTok{render}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{x =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM cohort WHERE subject_id = 1;"
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{translation-to-other-sql-dialects}{%
\subsection{Translation to other SQL dialects}\label{translation-to-other-sql-dialects}}

Another function of the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/SqlRender/}{SqlRender} package is to translate from OHDSI SQL to other SQL dialects. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM person;"}
\KeywordTok{translate}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{targetDialect =} \StringTok{"postgresql"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT  * FROM person LIMIT 10;"
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{targetDialect} parameter can have the following values: ``oracle'', ``postgresql'', ``pdw'', ``redshift'', ``impala'', ``netezza'', ``bigquery'', ``sqlite'', and ``sql server''.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
There are limits to what SQL functions and constructs can be translated properly, both because only a limited set of translation rules have been implemented in the package, but also some SQL features do not have an equivalent in all dialects. This is the primary reason why OHDSI SQL was developed as its own, new SQL dialect. However, whenever possible we have kept to the SQL Server syntax to avoid reinventing the wheel.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

Despite our best effords, there are quite a few things to consider when writing OHDSI SQL that will run without error on all supported platforms. In what follows we discuss these considerations in detail.

\textbf{Functions and structures supported by translate}

These SQL Server functions have been tested and were found to be translated correctly to the various dialects:

Similarly, many SQL syntax structures are supported. Here is a non-exhaustive lists of expressions that we know will translate well:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{-- Simple selects:}
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM} \KeywordTok{table}\NormalTok{;}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{String concatenation}

String concatenation is one area where SQL Server is less specific than other dialects. In SQL Server, one would write \texttt{SELECT\ first\_name\ +\ \textquotesingle{}\ \textquotesingle{}\ +\ last\_name\ AS\ full\_name\ FROM\ table}, but this should be \texttt{SELECT\ first\_name\ \textbar{}\textbar{}\ \textquotesingle{}\ \textquotesingle{}\ \textbar{}\textbar{}\ last\_name\ AS\ full\_name\ FROM\ table} in PostgreSQL and Oracle. SqlRender tries to guess when values that are being concatenated are strings. In the example above, because we have an explicit string (the space surrounded by single quotation marks), the translation will be correct. However, if the query had been \texttt{SELECT\ first\_name\ +\ last\_name\ AS\ full\_name\ FROM\ table}, SqlRender would have had no clue the two fields were strings, and would incorrectly leave the plus sign. Another clue that a value is a string is an explicit cast to VARCHAR, so \texttt{SELECT\ last\_name\ +\ CAST(age\ AS\ VARCHAR(3))\ AS\ full\_name\ FROM\ table} would also be translated correctly. To avoid ambiguity altogether, it is probable best to use the \texttt{CONCAT()} function to concatenate two or more strings.

\textbf{Table aliases and the AS keyword}

Many SQL dialects allow the use of the \texttt{AS} keyword when defining a table alias, but will also work fine without the keyword. For example, both these SQL statements are fine for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, RedShift, etc.:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{-- Using AS keyword}
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} 
\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ my_table }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ table_1}
\KeywordTok{INNER} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ (}
  \KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ other_table}
\NormalTok{) }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ table_2}
\KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ table_1.person_id }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ table_2.person_id;}

\CommentTok{-- Not using AS keyword}
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} 
\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ my_table table_1}
\KeywordTok{INNER} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ (}
  \KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ other_table}
\NormalTok{) table_2}
\KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ table_1.person_id }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ table_2.person_id;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

However, Oracle will throw an error when the \texttt{AS} keyword is used. In the above example, the first query will fail. It is therefore recommended to not use the \texttt{AS} keyword when aliasing tables. (Note: we can't make SqlRender handle this, because it can't easily distinguish between table aliases where Oracle doesn't allow \texttt{AS} to be used, and field aliases, where Oracle requires \texttt{AS} to be used.)

\textbf{Temp tables}

Temp tables can be very useful to store intermediate results, and when used correctly can be used to dramatically improve performance of queries. On most database platforms temp tables have very nice properties: they're only visible to the current user, are automatically dropped when the session ends, and can be created even when the user has no write access. Unfortunately, in Oracle temp tables are basically permanent tables, with the only difference that the data inside the table is only visible to the current user. This is why, in Oracle, SqlRender will try to emulate temp tables by

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Adding a random string to the table name so tables from different users will not conflict.
\item
  Allowing the user to specify the schema where the temp tables will be created.
\end{enumerate}

For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT * FROM #children;"}
\KeywordTok{translate}\NormalTok{(sql, }\DataTypeTok{targetDialect =} \StringTok{"oracle"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{oracleTempSchema =} \StringTok{"temp_schema"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "SELECT * FROM temp_schema.ktijk6lzchildren ;"
\end{verbatim}

Note that the user will need to have write privileges on \texttt{temp\_schema}.

Also note that because Oracle has a limit on table names of 30 characters, \textbf{temp table names are only allowed to be at most 22 characters long} because else the name will become too long after appending the session ID.

Furthermore, remember that temp tables are not automatically dropped on Oracle, so you will need to explicitly \texttt{TRUNCATE} and \texttt{DROP} all temp tables once you're done with them to prevent orphan tables accumulating in the Oracle temp schema.

\textbf{Implicit casts}

One of the few points where SQL Server is less explicit than other dialects is that it allows implicit casts. For example, this code will work on SQL Server:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{CREATE} \KeywordTok{TABLE}\NormalTok{ #temp (txt }\DataTypeTok{VARCHAR}\NormalTok{);}

\KeywordTok{INSERT} \KeywordTok{INTO}\NormalTok{ #temp}
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \StringTok{'1'}\NormalTok{;}

\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ #temp }\KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ txt }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Even though \texttt{txt} is a VARCHAR field and we are comparing it with an integer, SQL Server will automatically cast one of the two to the correct type to allow the comparison. In contrast, other dialects such as PostgreSQL will throw an error when trying to compare a VARCHAR with an INT.

You should therefore always make casts explicit. In the above example, the last statement should be replaced with either

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ #temp }\KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ txt }\OperatorTok{=} \FunctionTok{CAST}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1} \KeywordTok{AS} \DataTypeTok{VARCHAR}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ #temp }\KeywordTok{WHERE} \FunctionTok{CAST}\NormalTok{(txt }\KeywordTok{AS} \DataTypeTok{INT}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{=} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Case sensitivity in string comparisons}

Some DBMS platforms such as SQL Server always perform string comparisons in a case-insensitive way, while others such as PostgreSQL are always case sensitive. It is therefore recommended to always assume case-sensitive comparisons, and to explicitly make comparisons case-insensitive when unsure about the case. For example, instead of

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ concept }\KeywordTok{WHERE}\NormalTok{ concep_class_id }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{'Clinical Finding'}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

it is preferred to use

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ concept }\KeywordTok{WHERE} \FunctionTok{LOWER}\NormalTok{(concep_class_id) }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{'clinical finding'}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\textbf{Schemas and databases}

In SQL Server, tables are located in a schema, and schemas reside in a database. For example, \texttt{cdm\_data.dbo.person} refers to the \texttt{person} table in the \texttt{dbo} schema in the \texttt{cdm\_data} database. In other dialects, even though a similar hierarchy often exists they are used very differently. In SQL Server, there is typically one schema per database (often called \texttt{dbo}), and users can easily use data in different databases. On other platforms, for example in PostgreSQL, it is not possible to use data across databases in a single session, but there are often many schemas in a database. In PostgreSQL one could say that the equivalent of SQL Server's database is the schema.

We therefore recommend concatenating SQL Server's database and schema into a single parameter, which we typically call \texttt{@databaseSchema}. For example, we could have the parameterized SQL

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \OperatorTok{*} \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ @databaseSchema.person}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

where on SQL Server we can include both database and schema names in the value: \texttt{databaseSchema\ =\ "cdm\_data.dbo"}. On other platforms, we can use the same code, but now only specify the schema as the parameter value: \texttt{databaseSchema\ =\ "cdm\_data"}.

The one situation where this will fail is the \texttt{USE} command, since \texttt{USE\ cdm\_data.dbo;} will throw an error. It is therefore preferred not to use the \texttt{USE} command, but always specify the database / schema where a table is located.

\textbf{Debugging parameterized SQL}

Debugging parameterized SQL can be a bit complicated; Only the rendered SQL can be tested against a database server, but changes to the code should be made in the parameterized (pre-rendered) SQL.

A Shiny app is included in the SqlRender package for interactively editing source SQL and generating rendered and translated SQL. The app can be started using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{launchSqlRenderDeveloper}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Which will open the default browser with the app shown in Figure \ref{fig:sqlDeveloper}. The app is also publicly available on the web\footnote{\url{http://data.ohdsi.org/SqlDeveloper/}}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/SqlAndR/sqlDeveloper} 

}

\caption{The SqlDeveloper Shiny app.}\label{fig:sqlDeveloper}
\end{figure}

In the app you can enter OHDSI SQL, select the target dialect as well as provide values for the parameters that appear in your SQL, and the translation will automatically appear at the bottom.

\hypertarget{DatabaseConnector}{%
\section{DatabaseConnector}\label{DatabaseConnector}}

\href{https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/}{DatabaseConnector} is an R package for connecting to various database platforms using Java's JDBC drivers. The DatabaseConnector package is available on CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network), and can therefore be installed using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"DatabaseConnector"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

DatabaseConnector supports a wide array of technical platforms including traditional database systems (PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, and Oracle), parallel data warehouses (Microsoft APS, IBM Netezza, and Amazon RedShift), as well as Big Data platforms (Hadoop through Impala, and Google BigQuery). The package already contains most drivers, but because of licensing reasons the drivers for BigQuery, Netezza and Impala are not included but must be obtained by the user. Type \texttt{?jdbcDrivers} for instructions on how to download these drivers. Once downloaded, you can use the \texttt{pathToDriver} argument of the \texttt{connect}, \texttt{dbConnect}, and \texttt{createConnectionDetails} functions.

\hypertarget{creating-a-connection}{%
\subsection{Creating a connection}\label{creating-a-connection}}

To connect to a database a number of details need to be specified, such as the database platform, the location of the server, the user name, and password. We can call the \texttt{connect} function and specify these details directly:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{conn <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{dbms =} \StringTok{"postgresql"}\NormalTok{,}
                \DataTypeTok{server =} \StringTok{"localhost/postgres"}\NormalTok{,}
                \DataTypeTok{user =} \StringTok{"joe"}\NormalTok{,}
                \DataTypeTok{password =} \StringTok{"secret"}\NormalTok{,}
                \DataTypeTok{schema =} \StringTok{"cdm"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Connecting using PostgreSQL driver
\end{verbatim}

See \texttt{?connect} for information on which details are required for each platform. Don't forget to close any connection afterwards:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{disconnect}\NormalTok{(conn)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that, instead of providing the server name, it is also possible to provide the JDBC connection string if this is more convenient:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{connString <-}\StringTok{ "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres"}
\NormalTok{conn <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{connect}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{dbms =} \StringTok{"postgresql"}\NormalTok{,}
                \DataTypeTok{connectionString =}\NormalTok{ connString,}
                \DataTypeTok{user =} \StringTok{"joe"}\NormalTok{,}
                \DataTypeTok{password =} \StringTok{"secret"}\NormalTok{,}
                \DataTypeTok{schema =} \StringTok{"cdm"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Connecting using PostgreSQL driver
\end{verbatim}

Sometimes we may want to first specify the connection details, and defer connecting until later. This may be convenient for example when the connection is established inside a function, and the details need to be passed as an argument. We can use the \texttt{createConnectionDetails} function for this purpose:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{details <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createConnectionDetails}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{dbms =} \StringTok{"postgresql"}\NormalTok{,}
                                   \DataTypeTok{server =} \StringTok{"localhost/postgres"}\NormalTok{,}
                                   \DataTypeTok{user =} \StringTok{"joe"}\NormalTok{,}
                                   \DataTypeTok{password =} \StringTok{"secret"}\NormalTok{,}
                                   \DataTypeTok{schema =} \StringTok{"cdm"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{conn <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{connect}\NormalTok{(details)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Connecting using PostgreSQL driver
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{querying}{%
\subsection{Querying}\label{querying}}

The main functions for querying database are the \texttt{querySql} and \texttt{executeSql} functions. The difference between these functions is that \texttt{querySql} expects data to be returned by the database, and can handle only one SQL statement at a time. In contrast, \texttt{executeSql} does not expect data to be returned, and accepts multiple SQL statements in a single SQL string.

Some examples:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{querySql}\NormalTok{(conn, }\StringTok{"SELECT TOP 3 * FROM person"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##   PERSON_ID GENDER_CONCEPT_ID YEAR_OF_BIRTH
## 1         1              8507          1975
## 2         2              8507          1976
## 3         3              8507          1977
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{executeSql}\NormalTok{(conn, }\StringTok{"TRUNCATE TABLE foo; DROP TABLE foo;"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Both function provide extensive error reporting: When an error is thrown by the server, the error message and the offending piece of SQL are written to a text file to allow better debugging. The \texttt{executeSql} function also by default shows a progress bar, indicating the percentage of SQL statements that has been executed. If those attributes are not desired, the package also offers the \texttt{lowLevelQuerySql} and \texttt{lowLevelExecuteSql} functions.

\hypertarget{querying-using-ffdf-objects}{%
\subsection{Querying using ffdf objects}\label{querying-using-ffdf-objects}}

Sometimes the data to be fetched from the database is too large to fit into memory. As mentioned in Section \ref{BigDataSupport}, in such a case we can use the \texttt{ff} package to store R data objects on file, and use them as if they are available in memory. \texttt{DatabaseConnector} can download data directly into ffdf objects:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{querySql.ffdf}\NormalTok{(conn, }\StringTok{"SELECT * FROM person"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Where x is now an ffdf object.

\hypertarget{querying-different-platforms-using-the-same-sql}{%
\subsection{Querying different platforms using the same SQL}\label{querying-different-platforms-using-the-same-sql}}

The following convenience functions are available that first call the \texttt{render} and \texttt{translate} functions in the SqlRender package: \texttt{renderTranslateExecuteSql}, \texttt{renderTranslateQuerySql}, \texttt{renderTranslateQuerySql.ffdf}. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{renderTranslateQuerySql}\NormalTok{(conn, }
                             \DataTypeTok{sql =} \StringTok{"SELECT TOP 10 * FROM @schema.person"}\NormalTok{,}
                             \DataTypeTok{schema =} \StringTok{"cdm_synpuf"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that the SQL Server-specific `TOP 10' syntax will be translated to for example `LIMIT 10' on PostgreSQL, and that the SQL parameter \texttt{@schema} will be instantiated with the provided value `cdm\_synpuf'.

\hypertarget{inserting-tables}{%
\subsection{Inserting tables}\label{inserting-tables}}

Although it is also possible to insert data in the database by sending SQL statements using the \texttt{executeSql} function, it is often more convenient and faster (due to some optimization) to use the \texttt{insertTable} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{data}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}
\KeywordTok{insertTable}\NormalTok{(conn, }\StringTok{"mtcars"}\NormalTok{, mtcars, }\DataTypeTok{createTable =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this example, we're uploading the mtcars data frame to a table called `mtcars' on the server, which will be automatically created.

\hypertarget{QueryTheCdm}{%
\section{Querying the CDM}\label{QueryTheCdm}}

In the following examples we use OHDSI SQL to query a database that adheres to the CDM. These queries use \texttt{@cdm} to denote the database schema where the data in CDM can be found.

We can start by just querying how many people are in the database:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \FunctionTok{COUNT}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{) }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ person_count }\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ @cdm.person;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}r@{}}
\toprule
PERSON\_COUNT\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
26299001\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Or perhaps we're interested in the average length of an observation period:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \FunctionTok{AVG}\NormalTok{(DATEDIFF(}\DataTypeTok{DAY}\NormalTok{, }
\NormalTok{                    observation_period_start_date, }
\NormalTok{                    observation_period_end_date) }\OperatorTok{/} \FloatTok{365.25}\NormalTok{) }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ num_years}
\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ @cdm.observation_period;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}r@{}}
\toprule
NUM\_YEARS\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
1.980803\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

We can join tables to produce additional statistics. A join combines fields from multiple tables, typically by requiring specific fields in the tables to have the same value. For example, here we join the PERSON table to the OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table on the person\_id fields in both tables. In other words, the result of the join is a new table-like set that has all the fields of the two tables, but in all rows the person\_id fields from the two tables must have the same value. We can now for example compute the maximum age at observation end by using the observation\_period\_end\_date field from the OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table together with the year\_of\_birth field of the PERSON table:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \FunctionTok{MAX}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{YEAR}\NormalTok{(observation_period_end_date) }\OperatorTok{-}
\NormalTok{           year_of_birth) }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ max_age}
\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ @cdm.person}
\KeywordTok{INNER} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ @cdm.observation_period}
  \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ person.person_id }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ observation_period.person_id;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}r@{}}
\toprule
MAX\_AGE\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
90\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

A much more complicated query is needed to determine the distribution of age at the start of observation. In this query, we first join the PERSON to the OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table to compute age at start of observetion. We also compute the ordering for this joined set based on age, and store it as order\_nr. Because we want to use the result of this join multiple times, we define it as a common table expression (CTE) (defined using \texttt{WITH\ ...\ AS}) that we call ``ages'', meaning We can refer to ages as if it is an existing table. We count the number of rows in ages to produce ``n'', and then for each quantile find the minimum age where the order\_nr is smaller than the fraction times n.~For example, median we use the minimum age where \(order\_nr < .50 * n\). The minimum and maximum age are computed separately:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{WITH}\NormalTok{ ages}
\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ (}
    \KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ age,}
        \FunctionTok{ROW_NUMBER}\NormalTok{() }\KeywordTok{OVER}\NormalTok{ (}
            \KeywordTok{ORDER} \KeywordTok{BY}\NormalTok{ age}
\NormalTok{            ) order_nr}
    \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ (}
        \KeywordTok{SELECT} \DataTypeTok{YEAR}\NormalTok{(observation_period_start_date) }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{ year_of_birth }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ age}
        \KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ @cdm.person}
        \KeywordTok{INNER} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ @cdm.observation_period}
            \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ person.person_id }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ observation_period.person_id}
\NormalTok{        ) age_computed}
\NormalTok{    )}

More complex computations can also be performed in R instead of using SQL. For example, we can get the same answer using this R code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT YEAR(observation_period_start_date) -}
\StringTok{               year_of_birth AS age}
\StringTok{FROM @cdm.person}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm.observation_period}
\StringTok{  ON person.person_id = observation_period.person_id;"}
\NormalTok{age <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{renderTranslateQuerySql}\NormalTok{(conn, sql, }\DataTypeTok{cdm =} \StringTok{"cdm"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{quantile}\NormalTok{(age[, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{], }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.25}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{0.75}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##   0%  25%  50%  75% 100% 
##    0    6   17   34   90
\end{verbatim}

Here we compute age on the server, download all ages, and then compute the age distribution. However, this requires millions of rows of data to be downloaded from the database server, and is therefore not very efficient. You will need to decide on a case-by-case basis whether a computation is best performed in SQL or in R.

Queries can use the source values in the CDM. For example, we can retrieve the top 10 most frequent condition source codes using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT}\NormalTok{ TOP }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{ condition_source_value, }
  \FunctionTok{COUNT}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{) }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ code_count}
\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ @cdm.condition_occurrence}
\KeywordTok{GROUP} \KeywordTok{BY}\NormalTok{ condition_source_value}
\KeywordTok{ORDER} \KeywordTok{BY} \OperatorTok{-}\FunctionTok{COUNT}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rr@{}}

\end{longtable}

Here we grouped records in the CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table by values of the condition\_source\_value field, and counted the number of records in each group. We retrieve the condition\_source\_value and the count, and reverse-order it by the count.

\hypertarget{using-the-vocabulary-when-querying}{%
\section{Using the vocabulary when querying}\label{using-the-vocabulary-when-querying}}

Many operations require the vocabulary to be useful. The Vocabulary tables are part of the CDM, and are therefore available using SQL queries. Querying the Vocabulary is already described at length in Chapter \ref{StandardizedVocabularies}. Here we show how queries against the Vocabulary can be combined with queries against the CDM. Many fields in the CDM contain concept IDs which can be resolved using the CONCEPT table. For example, we may wish to count the number of persons in the database stratified by gender, and it would be convenient to resolve the GENDER\_CONCEPT\_ID field to a concept name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \FunctionTok{COUNT}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{) }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ subject_count,}
\NormalTok{  concept_name}
\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ @cdm.person}
\KeywordTok{INNER} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ @cdm.concept}
  \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ person.gender_concept_id }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ concept.concept_id}
\KeywordTok{GROUP} \KeywordTok{BY}\NormalTok{ concept_name;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}rr@{}}
\toprule
SUBJECT\_COUNT & CONCEPT\_NAME\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
14927548 & FEMALE\tabularnewline
11371453 & MALE\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

A very powerful feature of the Vocabulary is its hierarchy. A very common query looks for a specific concept \emph{and all of its descendants}. For example, image we wish to count the number of prescriptions containing the ingredient ibuprofen:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{SELECT} \FunctionTok{COUNT}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{*}\NormalTok{) }\KeywordTok{AS}\NormalTok{ prescription_count}
\KeywordTok{FROM}\NormalTok{ @cdm.drug_exposure}
\KeywordTok{INNER} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ @cdm.concept_ancestor}
  \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ drug_concept_id }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ descendant_concept_id}
\KeywordTok{INNER} \KeywordTok{JOIN}\NormalTok{ @cdm.concept ingredient}
  \KeywordTok{ON}\NormalTok{ ancestor_concept_id }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ ingredient.concept_id}
\KeywordTok{WHERE} \FunctionTok{LOWER}\NormalTok{(ingredient.concept_name) }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{'ibuprofen'}

\hypertarget{querylibrary}{%

TODO: update this section when QueryLibrary is finalized.

QueryLibrary is a library of commonly-used SQL queries for the CDM. It is available as an online application \footnote{\url{http:/data.ohdsi.org/QueryLibrary}} shown in Figure \ref{fig:queryLibrary}, and as an R package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/QueryLibrary}}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/SqlAndR/queryLibrary} 

}

\caption{QueryLibrary: a library of SQL queries against the CDM.}\label{fig:queryLibrary}
\end{figure}

The purpose of the library is to help new users learn how to query the CDM. The queries in the library have been reviewed and approved by the OHDSI community. The query library is primarily intended for training purposes, but is also a valuable resource for experienced users.

The QueryLibrary makes use of SqlRender to output the queries in the SQL dialect of choice. Users can also specify the CDM database schema, vocabulary database schema (if separate), and the Oracle temp schema (if needed), so the queries will be automatically rendered with these settings.

\hypertarget{problem-definition}{%
\subsection{Problem definition}\label{problem-definition}}

Angioedema is a well-known side-effect of ACE inhibitors (ACEi). \citet{slater_1988} estimate the incidence rate of angioedema in the first week of ACEi treatment to be one case per 3,000 patients per week. Here we seek to replicate this finding, and stratify by age and gender, thus answering the question

\begin{quote}
What is the rate of angioedema in the first week following ACEi treatment initiation, stratified by age and gender?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{exposure}{%
\subsection{Exposure}\label{exposure}}

We'll define exposure as first exposure to a drug containing an ingredient in the ACEi class. By first we mean no earlier exposure to any ingredient in the class. We require 365 days of continuous observation time prior to the first exposure.

\hypertarget{outcome}{%
\subsection{Outcome}\label{outcome}}

We define angioedema as any occurrence of an angioedema diagnose code during an inpatient or emergency room (ER) visit.

\hypertarget{time-at-risk}{%
\subsection{Time-at-risk}\label{time-at-risk}}

We will compute the incidence rate in the first week following treatment initiation, irrespective of whether patients were exposed for the full week.

\hypertarget{implementing-the-study-using-sql-and-r}{%
\section{Implementing the study using SQL and R}\label{implementing-the-study-using-sql-and-r}}

Although we are not bound to any of the OHDSI tool conventions, it is helpful to follow the same principles. In this case, we will use SQL to populate a cohort table, similarly to how the OHDSI tools work. The COHORT table is defined in the CDM, and has a predefined set of fields that we will also use. We first must create the COHORT table in a database schema where we have write access, which likely is not the same as the database schema that holds the data in CDM format.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(DatabaseConnector)}

\NormalTok{cdmDbSchema <-}\StringTok{ "cdm"}
\NormalTok{cohortDbSchema <-}\StringTok{ "scratch"}
\NormalTok{cohortTable <-}\StringTok{ "my_cohorts"}

\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "}
\StringTok{CREATE TABLE @cohort_db_schema.@cohort_table (}
\StringTok{  cohort_definition_id INT,}

\StringTok{);}
\StringTok{"}
\KeywordTok{renderTranslateExecuteSql}\NormalTok{(conn, sql,}
                          \DataTypeTok{cohort_db_schema =}\NormalTok{ cohortDbSchema,}
                          \DataTypeTok{cohort_table =}\NormalTok{ cohortTable)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here we have parameterized the database schema and table names, so we can easily adapt them to different environments. The result is an empty table on the database server.

\hypertarget{exposure-cohort}{%
\subsection{Exposure cohort}\label{exposure-cohort}}

Next we create our exposure cohort, and insert it into our COHORT table:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "}
\StringTok{INSERT INTO @cohort_db_schema.@cohort_table (}
\StringTok{  cohort_definition_id,}
\StringTok{  cohort_start_date,}
\StringTok{  cohort_end_date,}
\StringTok{  subject_id}
\StringTok{)}
\StringTok{SELECT 1 AS cohort_definition_id,}
\StringTok{  cohort_start_date,}
\StringTok{  cohort_end_date,}
\StringTok{  subject_id}
\StringTok{FROM (}
\StringTok{  SELECT MIN(drug_exposure_start_date) AS cohort_start_date,}
\StringTok{    MIN(drug_exposure_end_date) AS cohort_end_date,}
\StringTok{    person_id AS subject_id}
\StringTok{  FROM @cdm_db_schema.drug_exposure}
\StringTok{  INNER JOIN @cdm_db_schema.concept_ancestor}
\StringTok{    ON drug_concept_id = descendant_concept_id}
\StringTok{  WHERE ancestor_concept_id IN (1335471, 1340128, 1341927,}
\StringTok{    1363749, 1308216, 1310756, 1373225, 1331235, 1334456,}
\StringTok{    1342439) -- ACE inhibitors}
\StringTok{  GROUP BY person_id}
\StringTok{) first_exposure}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm_db_schema.observation_period}
\StringTok{  ON subject_id = person_id}
\StringTok{    AND observation_period_start_date < cohort_start_date}
\StringTok{    AND observation_period_end_date > cohort_start_date}
\StringTok{WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY,}
\StringTok{               observation_period_start_date,}
\StringTok{               cohort_start_date) >= 365;}
\StringTok{"}

\KeywordTok{renderTranslateExecuteSql}\NormalTok{(conn, sql,}
                          \DataTypeTok{cohort_db_schema =}\NormalTok{ cohortDbSchema,}
                          \DataTypeTok{cohort_table =}\NormalTok{ cohortTable,}
                          \DataTypeTok{cdm_db_schema =}\NormalTok{ cdmDbSchema)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here we use the DRUG\_EXPOSURE table, and join it the CONCEPT\_ANCESTOR table, thus allowing us to search for the ACEi ingredients and all their descendants, i.e.~all drugs containing an ACEi. We take the first drug exposure per person, and then join to the OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table, and because a person can have several observation periods we must make sure we only join to the period containing the drug exposure. We then require at least 365 days between the observation\_period\_start\_date and the cohort\_start\_date.

\hypertarget{outcome-cohort}{%
\subsection{Outcome cohort}\label{outcome-cohort}}

Finally, we must create our outcome cohort:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "}
\StringTok{INSERT INTO @cohort_db_schema.@cohort_table (}
\StringTok{ cohort_definition_id,}
\StringTok{ cohort_start_date,}
\StringTok{ cohort_end_date,}
\StringTok{subject_id}
\StringTok{)}
\StringTok{SELECT 2 AS cohort_definition_id,}
\StringTok{  cohort_start_date,}
\StringTok{  cohort_end_date,}
\StringTok{  subject_id}
\StringTok{FROM (}
\StringTok{  SELECT DISTINCT person_id AS subject_id,}
\StringTok{    condition_start_date AS cohort_start_date,}
\StringTok{    condition_end_date AS cohort_end_date}
\StringTok{  FROM @cdm_db_schema.condition_occurrence}
\StringTok{  INNER JOIN @cdm_db_schema.concept_ancestor}
\StringTok{    ON condition_concept_id = descendant_concept_id}
\StringTok{  WHERE ancestor_concept_id = 432791 -- Angioedema}
\StringTok{) distinct_occurrence}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm_db_schema.visit_occurrence}
\StringTok{  ON subject_id = person_id}
\StringTok{  AND visit_start_date <= cohort_start_date}
\StringTok{  AND visit_end_date >= cohort_start_date}
\StringTok{WHERE visit_concept_id IN (262, 9203,}
\StringTok{    9201) -- Inpatient or ER;}
\StringTok{"}

\KeywordTok{renderTranslateExecuteSql}\NormalTok{(conn, sql,}
                          \DataTypeTok{cohort_db_schema =}\NormalTok{ cohortDbSchema,}
                          \DataTypeTok{cohort_table =}\NormalTok{ cohortTable,}
                          \DataTypeTok{cdm_db_schema =}\NormalTok{ cdmDbSchema)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here we join the CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table to the CONCEPT\_ANCESTOR table to find all occurrences of angioedema or any of its descendants. We use DISTINCT to make sure we only select one record per day, as we believe multiple angioedema diagnoses on the same day are more likely to be the same occurrence rather than multiple angioedema events. We join these occurrences to the VISIT\_OCCURRENCE table to ensure the diagnose was made in and inpatient or ER setting.

\hypertarget{incidence-rate-calculation}{%
\subsection{Incidence rate calculation}\label{incidence-rate-calculation}}

Now that our cohorts are in place, we can compute the incidence rate, stratified by age and gender:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "}
\StringTok{WITH tar AS (}
\StringTok{  SELECT concept_name AS gender,}
\StringTok{    FLOOR((YEAR(cohort_start_date) -}

\StringTok{    subject_id,}
\StringTok{    cohort_start_date,}
\StringTok{    CASE WHEN DATEADD(DAY, 7, cohort_start_date) >}
\StringTok{      observation_period_end_date}
\StringTok{    THEN observation_period_end_date}
\StringTok{    ELSE DATEADD(DAY, 7, cohort_start_date)}
\StringTok{    END AS cohort_end_date}
\StringTok{  FROM @cohort_db_schema.@cohort_table}

\StringTok{      AND observation_period_end_date > cohort_start_date}
\StringTok{  INNER JOIN @cdm_db_schema.person}
\StringTok{    ON subject_id = person.person_id}
\StringTok{  INNER JOIN @cdm_db_schema.concept}
\StringTok{    ON gender_concept_id = concept_id}
\StringTok{  WHERE cohort_definition_id = 1 -- Exposure}
\StringTok{)}
\StringTok{SELECT days.gender,}
\StringTok{    days.age,}
\StringTok{    days,}
\StringTok{    CASE WHEN events IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE events END AS events}
\StringTok{FROM (}
\StringTok{  SELECT gender,}
\StringTok{    age,}
\StringTok{    SUM(DATEDIFF(DAY, cohort_start_date,}
\StringTok{      cohort_end_date)) AS days}
\StringTok{  FROM tar}
\StringTok{  GROUP BY gender,}
\StringTok{    age}
\StringTok{) days}
\StringTok{LEFT JOIN (}
\StringTok{  SELECT gender,}

\StringTok{      COUNT(*) AS events}
\StringTok{  FROM tar}
\StringTok{  INNER JOIN @cohort_db_schema.@cohort_table angioedema}
\StringTok{    ON tar.subject_id = angioedema.subject_id}
\StringTok{      AND tar.cohort_start_date <= angioedema.cohort_start_date}
\StringTok{      AND tar.cohort_end_date >= angioedema.cohort_start_date}
\StringTok{  WHERE cohort_definition_id = 2 -- Outcome}
\StringTok{  GROUP BY gender,}
\StringTok{    age}
\StringTok{) events}
\StringTok{ON days.gender = events.gender}
\StringTok{  AND days.age = events.age;}
\StringTok{"}

\NormalTok{results <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{renderTranslateQuerySql}\NormalTok{(conn, sql,}
                                   \DataTypeTok{cohort_db_schema =}\NormalTok{ cohortDbSchema,}
                                   \DataTypeTok{cohort_table =}\NormalTok{ cohortTable,}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We first create ``tar'', a CTE that contains all exposures with the appropriate time-at-risk. Note that we truncate the time-at-risk at the observation\_period\_end\_date. We also compute the age in 10-year bins, and identify the gender. The advantage of using a CTE is that we can use the same set of intermediate results several times in a query. In this case we use it to count the total amount of time-at-risk, as well as the number of angioedema events that occur during the time-at-risk.

We use \texttt{snakeCaseToCamelCase\ =\ TRUE} because in SQL we tend to use snake\_case for field names (because SQL in case-insensitive), whereas in R we tend to use camelCase (because R is case-sensitive). The \texttt{results} data frame column names will now be in camelCase.

With the help of the ggplot2 package we can easily plot our results:

Because we use OHDSI SQL together with DatabaseConnector and SqlRender throughout, the code we reviewed here will run on any database platform supported by OHDSI.

Note that for demonstration purposes we chose to create our cohorts using hand-crafted SQL. It would probably have been more convenient to construct cohort definition in ATLAS, and use the SQL generated by ATLAS to instantiate the cohorts. ATLAS also produced OHDSI SQL, and can therefore easily be used together with SqlRender and DatabaseConnector.

\chapter{Building the building blocks: cohorts}\label{Cohorts}}

Contributors: Kristin Kostka, Patrick Ryan, Jon Duke, Juan Banda \& Joel Swerdel

Cohorts are used throughout OHDSI analytical tools and network studies as the primary building blocks for running high quality, systematic research. Cohort definitions vary from study to study depending on the research question of interest. Each cohort defines a specific way to represent a person with a condition or exposure using data in an observational health database. Thus, cohorts are an important component in documenting the methods of an observational research study.

The chapter serves to explain what is meant by creating and sharing cohort definitions, the methods for developing cohorts, and examples of how to build your own cohorts using ATLAS (see Chapter \ref{OhdsiAnalyticsTools}) and SQL queries against the Common Data Model (CDM).

\hypertarget{theory}{%
\section{Theory}\label{theory}}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
\textbf{OHDSI Cohort Definition:} A cohort is defined as a set of persons who satisfy one or more inclusion criteria for a duration of time.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

In many peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts, a cohort definition is suggested to be analogous to a codeset of specific clinical codes (e.g.~ICD-9/ICD-10, NDC, HCPCS, etc). While codesets are an important piece to assembling a cohort, a cohort definition is not simply a codesets. A cohort definition requires logic for how to use the codeset in a criteria. A well documented cohort specifies how a patient enters a cohort, a patient exits a cohort and any additional inclusion criteria that impacts how to observe a patient's time-at-risk.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
The term \emph{cohort} is often interchanged with the term phenotype. The term \emph{phenotype} is applied to patient characteristics inferred from electronic health record (EHR) data (Hripcsak citation). The goal is to draw conclusions about a target concept based on raw EHR data, claims data, or other clinically relevant data. Thus, a \emph{cohort} is a set of persons who satisfy one or more inclusion criteria (a phenotype) for a duration of time. A cohort in itself is not a phenotype but a phenotype can be used to create a cohort.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

There are two main approaches to constructing a cohort: \textbf{1) rules-based design} or \textbf{2) probabilistic design}. A rules-based cohort design relies heavily on the domain expertise of the individual designing the cohort to use their knowledge of the therapeutic area of interest to build rules to qualify potential cohort membership. Conversely, a probabilistic design mines already available data to identify and qualify potential cohort membership through machine-suggested patterns. The next sections will discuss these approaches in further detail.

\hypertarget{rules-based-cohort-design}{%
\subsection{Rules-based cohort design}\label{rules-based-cohort-design}}

A rules-based OHDSI cohort definition begins by an expert-consensus stating one or more inclusion criteria (e.g.~``people with angioedema'') in a specific duration of time (e.g.~``who developed this condition within the last 6 months'').

When creating a cohort definition, you need to ask yourself the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{What initial event(s) define cohort entry?}
\item
  \emph{What inclusion criteria are applied to the initial events?}
\item
  \emph{What defines a person's cohort exit?}
\end{itemize}

To visualize the importance of these criteria, think of how this information comes together in a person's timeline. The OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table creates the window for which we see the person in the data.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Cohorts/cohort-build} \caption{Cohort Creation}\label{fig:cohortBuild}
\end{figure}

\emph{Cohort entry criteria:} The cohort entry event can be one or many clinical attributes which dictate an individual patient's eligibility to be included in a cohort. Events are recorded time-stamped observations for the persons, such as drug exposures, conditions, procedures, measurements and visits. The event index date is set to be equal to the event start date. Initial events defined by a domain, concept set, and any domain-specific attributes required.

\emph{Inclusion criteria:} The qualifying cohort will be defined as all persons who have an initial event and satisfy all qualifying inclusion criteria. Each inclusion criterion is defined by domain(s), concept set(s), domain-specific attributes, and the temporal logic relative to initial events. Each qualifying inclusion criterion can be evaluated to determine the impact of the criteria on the attrition of persons from the initial cohort.

\emph{Cohort exit criteria:} The cohort exit event signifies when a person no longer qualifies for cohort membership. Cohort exit can be defined in multiple ways such as the end of the observation period, a fixed time interval relative to the initial entry event, the last event in a sequence of related observations (e.g.~persistent drug exposure) or through other censoring of observation period. Cohort exit strategy will impact whether a person can belong to the cohort multiple times during different time intervals.

\emph{Time-at-risk:} In order to interpret risk of a specific outcome, which will be defined as a separate cohort definition, it is necessary to know the length of time that applies. A time-at-risk criteria states the period of time in which the cohort must be in the data following the cohort entry criteria. The time-at-risk will vary based on whether you're observing an acute/short term trend or a chronic/long term trend.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Cohorts/cohort-TAR} \caption{Time-at-Risk Construction}\label{fig:cohortTar}
\end{figure}

In traditional study design, we would categorize time-at-risk for `on treatment' as the entirety of the time between when a person meets cohort entry through the cohort exit criteria. An `intent-to-treat' design would be the entirety of the time from the cohort start through the observation period ending (e.g.~when the person leaves the data because they've switched physicians, insurance carriers, etc).

The use of these criteria may present a number of unique nuances to an OHDSI cohort including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One person may belong to multiple cohorts
\item
  One person may belong to the same cohort at multiple different time periods
\item
  One person may not belong to the same cohort multiple times during the same period of time
\item
  One cohort may have zero or more members
\end{itemize}

Throughout the Book of OHDSI, we will detail how to address these consequences in your overall study design. In each respective methodology, we will discuss how you can configure a methods package to address how one person shows up in multiple cohorts being studied.

\hypertarget{probabilistic-cohort-design-using-aphrodite}{%
\subsection{Probabilistic cohort design using APHRODITE}\label{probabilistic-cohort-design-using-aphrodite}}

Rules-based cohort design are a popular method for assembling cohort definitions. However, assembling necessary expert consensus to create a study cohort can be prohibitively time consuming. Probabilistic cohort design is an alternative, machine-driven method to expedite the selection of cohort attributes. In this method, supervised learning allows a phenotyping algorithm to learn from a set of labeled examples (cases) of what attributes contribute to cohort membership. This algorithm can then be used to better ascertain the defining characteristics of a phenotype and what trade offs occur in overall study accuracy when choosing to modify phenotype criteria.

To apply this approach on OMOP data, OHDSI community researchers created Automated PHenotype Routine for Observational Definition, Identification, Training and Evaluation (APHRODITE), an R-package cohort building framework that combines the ability of learning from imperfectly labeled data and the Anchor learning framework for improving selected features in the phenotype models, for use with the OHDSI/OMOP CDM (reference: \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28815104}). APHRODITE is an open-source package (\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/Aphrodite}) available for use which provides the OHDSI data network to the ability to start building electronic phenotype models that leverage machine learning techniques and go beyond traditional rule based approaches to cohort building.

\hypertarget{phenotype-evaluation}{%
\section{Phenotype Evaluation}\label{phenotype-evaluation}}

The systematic reuse of cohort definitions and the subsequent evaluation of phenotypes to characterize components of disease remains an ongoing piece of work within the OHDSI Community. A literature review of over 33 studies found significant heterogeneity in phenotype algorithms used, validation methods, and results (Swerdel reference). In general, the validation of a rules-based cohort definition or probabilistic algorithm can be thought of as a test of the proposed cohort compared to some form of ``gold standard'' reference (e.g.~manual chart review of cases).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Cohorts/cohort-PPV} \caption{Algorithm Evaluation}\label{fig:cohortPpv}
\end{figure}

For a complete validation of an algorithm, we need to calculate:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Sensitivity} = True Positive (TP) / (True Positive + False Negative)
\item
  \textbf{Specificity} = True Negative (TN) / (True Negative + False Positive)
\item
  \textbf{Positive Predictive Value} = TP / (True Positive + False Positive)
\end{itemize}

This framework continues to be utilized across cohort definition research to evaluate the utility of reuse of cohorts across different electronic health data.

\hypertarget{ohdsi-gold-standard-phenotype-library}{%
\section{OHDSI Gold Standard Phenotype Library}\label{ohdsi-gold-standard-phenotype-library}}

To assist the community in evaluation of existing cohort definitions and algorithms, the OHDSI Gold Standard Phenotype Library (GSPL) Workgroup was formed. The purpose of the GSPL workgroup is to provide additional leadership to the development of community-backed cohort libraries from rules-based and probabilistic methods. The GPSL enable members of the OHDSI community to find, evaluate, and utilize community-validated cohort definitions for research and other activities. These ``gold standard'' definitions will reside in a library, the entries of which are held to specific standards of design and evaluation. For additional information related to the GSPL, consult the OHDSI workgroup page (\url{https://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=projects:workgroups:gold-library-wg}).

\hypertarget{practice}{%
\section{Practice}\label{practice}}

Building a cohort starts with asking a question: ``I want to find patients who initiate ACE inhibitors monotherapy as first-line treatments for hypertension.''

Before you can define a cohort, you will need to construct OMOP concept sets. OMOP concept sets represent the sets of clinical codes that are strung together with other logical expressions to create your cohort. A detailed discussion of OMOP concept sets can be found \ref{StandardizedVocabularies}. Cohort inclusion criteria are created using specific attributes of data in the OMOP CDM (e.g.~condition occurrence, drug era, drug exposure, observation period, visit, etc). OHDSI domains are analogous to building blocks to contribute cohort attributes:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Cohorts/cohort-legos} \caption{Building Blocks of Cohorts}\label{fig:cohortLegos}
\end{figure}

Prior to building a cohort, refer to the Common Data Model (Chapter \ref{CommonDataModel}) to understand what data elements are available for defining a cohort. When you are building a cohort, you should consider which of these is more important to you, finding all the eligible patients? \emph{vs.} Getting only the ones you are confident about?

Your strategy to construct your cohort will depend on your definition stringency. The right cohort design will depend on the question you're trying to answer. You may opt to build a cohort definition that: uses everything you can get, uses the lowest common denominator so you can share or is a compromise of the two. It is ultimately at the researcher's discretion what, threshold of stringency is necessary to adequately study the cohort of interest.

\chapter{Characterization}\label{Characterization}}

\emph{Chapter leads: Anthony Sena, Daniel Prieto-Alhambra}

Observational healthcare data sources provide a valuable resource to understand variations in populations based on a host of characteristics. Characterizing populations through the use of descriptive statistics is an important first step in generating hypotheses about the determinants of health and disease. In this chapter we cover methods for characterization:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Database-level characterization}: provides a top-level set of summary statistics to understand the data profile of a data source in its totality.
\item
  \textbf{Cohort characterization}: describes a population in terms of its aggregate medical history.
\item
  \textbf{Treatment pathways}: describes the sequence of interventions a person received for a duration of time.
\item
  \textbf{Incidence}: measures the occurrence rate of an outcome in a population for a time at risk.
\end{itemize}

Broadly, these methods aim to describe what happens to persons during their history anchored on a given index date, based usually on the key diagnosis or treatment that makes them eligible for the cohort. Use-cases for characterization include disease natural history, treatment utilization and quality improvement.

In this chapter will describe the methods for characterization. We will use a population of hypternsive persons to demonstrate how to use ATLAS and R to perform these characterization tasks.

\hypertarget{database-level-characterization}{%
\section{Database Level Characterization}\label{database-level-characterization}}

Before we can answer any characterization question about a population, we must first understand the characteristics of the data source we intend to utilize. Database level characterization seeks to describe the totality of a data set in terms of the temporal trends, distributions and data completeness. This quantitative assessment of a data set will typically include questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the total count of persons in this data set?
\item
  What is the distribution of age for persons?
\item
  How long are persons in this data set observed for?
\item
  What is the proportion of persons having a \{treatment, condition, procedure, etc\} recorded/prescribed over time?
\end{itemize}

These database-level descriptive statistics also help a researcher to understand what data may be missing in a data set. Chapter \ref{DataQuality} goes into further detail on data quality.

\hypertarget{cohort-characterization}{%
\section{Cohort characterization}\label{cohort-characterization}}

Cohort characterization is the natural first step to explore the baseline and post-index characteristics of people in a cohort. We typically summarize the medical history of persons in a cohort in terms of socio-demographics, concomitant medications, procedures, comorbid conditions and other medical observations recorded in a data set. The dissemination of this characterization is recommended as a best practice for research papers by the Strengthening the Reporting of Observation Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines \citep{VONELM2008344}.

OHDSI approaches characterization through descriptive statistics of all conditions, drug and device exposures, procedures and other clinical observations that are present in the person's history. This approach provides a complete view of the persons recorded history. Importantly, this enables a full exploration of the cohort history with an eye towards variation in the data while also allowing for identification of potentially missing values. Cohort characterisation methods can be used for person-level drug utilisation studies (DUS) to estimate the prevalence of indications and contraindications amongst users of a given treatment.

\hypertarget{treatment-pathways}{%
\section{Treatment Pathways}\label{treatment-pathways}}

Another method to characterize a population is to describe the treatment sequence over time. Hripcsak et al.~utilized the OHDSI common data standards to create descriptive statistics to characterize treatment pathways for type 2 diabetes, hypertension and depression persons \citep{Hripcsak7329}. By standardizing this analytic approach, Hripcsak and colleagues were able to run the same analysis across the OHDSI network to describe the characteristics of hypertensive persons across the network.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/pnasTreatmentPathwaysTimeline} 

}

\caption{OHDSI Treatment Pathways event flow.}\label{fig:treatmentPathwaysEventFlow}
\end{figure}

The design of the pathway analysis, as shown in the figure above, aims to summarize the treatments (events) received by persons diagnosed with an index condition or from the first prescription/dispensation of a specific therapy. In this particular example, treatments were described after the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and depression. The events for each person were then aggregated to a set of summary statistics and visualized for a data source:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/pnasTreatmentPathwaysSunburst} 

}

\caption{OHDSI Treatment Pathways “sunburst” visualization for hypertension}\label{fig:treatmentPathwaysSunburstDataViz}
\end{figure}

The figure represents a population of persons initiating treatment for hypertension. The first ring in the center shows the proportion of persons based on their first-line therapy. In this example, Hydrochlorothiazide is the most common first-line therapy for this population. The boxes that extend from the Hydrochlorothiazide section represent the 2nd and 3rd line therapies recorded for persons in the cohort.

A pathways analysis provides important evidence about treatment utilization amongst a population. From this analysis we can describe the most prevalent first-line therapies utilized, the proportion of persons that discontinue treatment, switch treatments or augment their therapy.

In classic DUS terminology, treatment pathway analyses include some population-level DUS estimates such as prevalence of use of one or more medications in a specified population, as well as some person-level DUS including measures of persistence and switching between different therapies.

\hypertarget{incidence}{%
\section{Incidence}\label{incidence}}

Incidence rates and proportions are statistics that are used in public health to assess the occurrence of an outcome in a population during a time-at-risk. The figure below aims to show the components of an incidence calculation for a single person:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/incidenceTimeline} 

}

\caption{Person-level view of incidence calculation components}\label{fig:incidenceTimeline}
\end{figure}

In the figure above, a person has a period of time where they are observed in the data denoted by their observation start and end time. Next, the person has a point in time where they enter and exit a cohort by meeting some eligibility criteria. The time at risk window then denotes when we seek to understand the occurrence of an outcome. If the outcome falls into the time-at-risk, we count that as an incidence of the outcome.

There are two metrics for calculating incidence:

\begin{equation} 
Incidence\;Proportion = \frac{\#\;persons\;in\;the\;cohort\;with\;new\;outcome\;during\;time\;at\;risk}{\#\;persons\;in\;the\;cohort\;with\;time\;at\;risk}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} 
Incidence\;Rate = \frac{\#\;persons\;in\;the\;cohort\;with\;new\;outcome\;during\;time\;at\;risk}{person\;time\;at\;risk\;contributed\;by\;persons\;in\;the\;cohort}
\end{equation}

When calculated for certain therapies, incidence proportions and incidence rates of use of a given therapy/ies are classic population-level DUS.

\hypertarget{characterizing-hypertensive-persons}{%
\section{Characterizing hypertensive persons}\label{characterizing-hypertensive-persons}}

Per the World Health Organization's global brief on hypertension \citep{WHOHypertension}, there are significant health and economic gains attached to early detection, adequate treatment and good control of hypertension. Treating the complications of hypertension entails interventions such as cardiac bypass surgery, carotid artery surgery and dialysis. In the subsequent sections of this chapter, we'll explore the ways that we make use of ATLAS and R to explore a data set to understand its composition for studying hypertensive persons. Then, we will use these same tools to describe the natural history and treatment patterns of hypertensive persons.

\hypertarget{database-characterization-in-atlas}{%
\section{Database characterization in ATLAS}\label{database-characterization-in-atlas}}

Observational data housed in the OMOP common data model (CDM) are characterized using ACHILLES (\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{C}haracterization of \textbf{H}ealth \textbf{I}nformation at \textbf{L}arge-scale \textbf{L}ongitudinal \textbf{E}xploration \textbf{S}ystem). ACHILLES facilitates the characterization, quality assessment and visualization of observational health databases.

\texttt{Are\ there\ any\ references\ to\ other\ chapters\ we\ should\ included\ here?}

Here we demonstrate how to use the data sources module in ATLAS to explore database characterization statistics created with ACHILLES to find database level characteristics related to hypertensive persons. Start by clicking on \includegraphics{images/Characterization/atlasDataSourcesMenuItem.png} in the left bar of ATLAS to start. In the first drop down list shown in ATLAS, select the data source to explore. Next, use the drop down below the data source to start exploring reports. To do this, select the Condition Occurrence from the report drop down which will reveal a treemap visualization of all conditions present in the database:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasDataSourcesConditionTreemap} 

}

\caption{Atlas Data Sources: Condition Occurrence Treemap}\label{fig:atlasDataSourcesConditionTreemap}
\end{figure}

To search for a specific condition of interest, click on the Table tab to reveal the full list of conditions in the data set with person count, prevalence and records per person. Using the filter box on the top, we can filter down the entries in the table based on concept name containing the term ``hypertension'':

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasDataSourcesConditionFiltered} 

}

\caption{Atlas Data Sources: Conditions with “hypertension” found in the concept name}\label{fig:atlasDataSourcesConditionFiltered}
\end{figure}

We can explore a detailed drill down report of a condition by clicking on a row. In this case, we will select ``essential hypertension'' to get a breakdown of the trends of the selected condition over time and by gender, the prevalence of the condition by month, the type recorded with the condition and the age at first occurrence of the diagnosis:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasDataSourcesDrillDownReport} 

}

\caption{Atlas Data Sources: Essential hypertension drill down report}\label{fig:atlasDataSourcesDrillDownReport}
\end{figure}

Now that we have reviewed the database's characteristics for the presence of hypertension concepts and the trends over time, we can also explore drugs used to treat hypertensive persons. The process to do this follows the steps except we could use the Drug Era report to review characteristics of drugs summarized to their RxNorm Ingredient. Once we have explored the database characteristics to review items of interest, we are ready to move forward with constructing cohorts to identify the hypertensive persons to characterize.

\hypertarget{cohort-characterization-in-atlas}{%
\section{Cohort characterization in ATLAS}\label{cohort-characterization-in-atlas}}

Here we demonstrate how to use ATLAS to perform large-scale cohort characterization for several cohorts. Click on the \includegraphics{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationMenuItem.png} in the left bar of ATLAS and create a new characterization analysis. Give the analysis a name a save using the \includegraphics{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/save.png} button.

\texttt{Note:\ should\ we\ move\ the\ save\ button\ to\ an\ "atlas"\ folder?}

\hypertarget{design}{%
\subsection{Design}\label{design}}

A characterization analysis requires at least one cohort and at least one feature to characterize. For this example, we will use two cohorts. The first cohort will define persons initiating a treatment for hypertension as their index date with at least one diagnosis of hypertension in the year prior. We will also require that persons in this cohort have at least one year of observation after initiating the hypertensive drug. The second cohort is identical to the first cohort described with a requirement having at least three years of observation instead of one.

\texttt{The\ cohort\ definitions\ used\ in\ this\ chapter\ are\ found\ in\ Appendix\ X.}

\hypertarget{cohort-definitions}{%
\subsubsection{Cohort definitions}\label{cohort-definitions}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationCohortSelection} 

}

\caption{Characterization design tab - cohort definition selection}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationCohortSelection}
\end{figure}

We assume the cohorts have already been created in ATLAS as described in Chapter \ref{Cohorts}. Click on the and select the cohorts as shown in the figure above. Next, we'll define the features to use for characterizing these two cohorts.

\hypertarget{feature-selection}{%
\subsubsection{Feature Selection}\label{feature-selection}}

ATLAS comes with nearly 100 preset features that are used to perform characterization across the clinical domains modeled in the OMOP CDM. Under the hood, ATLAS is utilizing the OHDSI FeatureExtraction R package to perform the characterization for each cohort. We will cover the use of FeatureExtraction and R in more detail in the next section.

Click on to select the feature to characterize. Below is a list of features we will use to characterize these cohorts:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationFeatureSelection} 

}

\caption{Characterization design tab - feature selection.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationFeatureSelection}
\end{figure}

The figure above shows the list of features selected along with a description of what each feature will characterize for each cohort. The features that start with the name ``Demographics'' will calculate the demographic information for each person at the cohort start date. For the features that start with a domain name (i.e.~Visit, Procedure, Condition, Drug, etc), these will characterize all recorded observations in that domain. Each domain feature has four options of time window preceding the cohort star, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Any time prior}: uses all available time prior to cohort start that fall into the person's observation period
\item
  \textbf{Long term}: 365 days prior up to and including the cohort start date.
\item
  \textbf{Medium term}: 180 days prior up to and including the cohort start date.
\item
  \textbf{Short term}: 30 days prior up to and including the cohort start date.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{subgroup-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Subgroup analysis}\label{subgroup-analysis}}

What if we were interested in creating different characteristics based on gender? We can use the ``subgroup analyses'' section to define new subgroups of interest to use in our characterization.

To create a subgroup, click on and add your criteria for subgroup membership. This step is similar to the criteria used to identify cohort enrollment. In this example, we'll define a set of criteria to identify females amongst our cohorts:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationSubgroup} 

}

\caption{Characterization design with female sub group analysis.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationSubgroup}
\end{figure}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
IMPORTANT: Subgroup analyses in ATLAS are not the same as strata. Strata are mutually exclusive while subgroups may include the same persons based on the criteria chosen.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

\hypertarget{executions}{%
\subsection{Executions}\label{executions}}

Once we have our characterization designed, we can execute this design against one or more CDMs in our environment. Navigate to the Executions tab and click on the Generate button to start the analysis on a data source:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationExecutions} 

}

\caption{Characterization design execution - CDM source selection.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationExecutions}
\end{figure}

Once the analysis is complete, we can view reports by clicking on the ``All Executions'' button and from the list of executions, select ``View Reports''. Alternatively, you can click ``View latest result'' to view the last execution performed.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationResultsSummary} 

}

\caption{Characterization results - condition occurrence long term.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationResultsSummary}
\end{figure}

The results provide a tabular view of the different features for each cohort selected in the design. In the example above, a table provides a summary of all conditions present in the two cohorts in the preceding 365 days from the cohort start. Each covariate has a count and percentage for each cohort and the female subgroup we defined within each cohort.

We used the search box to filter the results to see what proportion of persons have a \texttt{cardiac\ arrhythmia} in their history in an effort to understand what cardiovascular-related diagnoses are observed in the populations. We can use the \texttt{Explore} link next to the cardiac arrhythmia concept to open a new window with more details about the concept for a single cohort:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationResultsExplore} 

}

\caption{Characterization results - exploring a single concept.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationResultsExplore}
\end{figure}

Since we have characterized all condition concepts for our cohorts, the explore option enables a view of all ancestor and descendant concepts for the selected concept, in this case cardiac arrhythmia. This exploration allows us to navigate the hierarchy of concepts to explore other cardiac diseases that may appear for our hypertensive persons. Like in the summary view, the count and percentage is displayed.

We can also use the same characterization results to find conditions that are contraindicated for some anti-hypertensive treatment such as angioedema. To do this, we'll follow the same steps above but this time search for `edema':

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationResultsContra} 

}

\caption{Characterization results - exploring a contraindicated condition.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationResultsContra}
\end{figure}

Once again, we'll use the explore feature to see the characteristics of Edema in the hypertension population to find the prevalence of angioedema:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationResultsContraExplore} 

}

\caption{Characterization results - exploring a contraindicated condition details.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationResultsContraExplore}
\end{figure}

Here we find that a portion of this population has a record of angioedema in the year prior to starting an anti-hypertensive medication.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationResultsContinuous} 

}

\caption{Characterization results of age for each cohort and sub group.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationResultsContinuous}
\end{figure}

While domain covariates are computed using a binary indicator (i.e.~was a record of the code present in the prior timeframe), some variables provide a continuous value such as the age of persons at cohort start. In the example above, we show the age for the 2 cohorts characterized expressed with the count of persons, mean age, median age and standard deviation.

\hypertarget{defining-custom-features}{%
\subsection{Defining custom features}\label{defining-custom-features}}

In addition to the preset features, ATLAS supports the ability to allow for user-defined custom features. To do this, click the \textbf{Characterization} left-hand menu item, then click the \textbf{Feature Analysis} tab and click the \textbf{New Feature Analysis} button. Provide a name for the custom feature and save it using the \includegraphics{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/save.png} button.

\texttt{Note:\ should\ we\ move\ the\ save\ button\ to\ an\ "atlas"\ folder?}

In this example, we will define a custom feature that will identify the count of persons in each cohort that have a drug era of ACE inhibitors in their history after cohort start:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationCustomFeature} 

}

\caption{Custom feature definition in ATLAS.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationCustomFeature}
\end{figure}

The criteria defined above assumes that it will be applied to a cohort start date. Once we have defined the criteria and saved it, we can apply it to the characterization design we created in the previous section. To do this, open the characterization design and navigate to the Feature Analysis section. Click the \includegraphics{images/Characterization/atlasImportButton.png} button and from the menu select the new custom features. They will now appear in the feature list for the characterization design. As described earlier, we can execute this design against a data source to produce the characterization for this custom feature:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasCharacterizationCustomFeatureResults} 

}

\caption{Custom feature results display.}\label{fig:atlasCharacterizationCustomFeatureResults}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{cohort-characterization-in-r}{%
\section{Cohort characterization in R}\label{cohort-characterization-in-r}}

We may also choose to characterize cohorts using R. Here we'll describe how to use the OHDSI R package FeatureExtraction to generate baseline features (covariates) for our hypertension cohorts \texttt{(Appendix\ X)}.
FeatureExtraction provides users with the ability to construct covariates in three ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Choose the default set of covariates
\item
  Choose from a set of prespecified analyses
\item
  Create a set of custom analyses
\end{itemize}

FeatureExtraction creates covariates in two distinct ways: person-level features and aggregate features. Person-level features are useful for machine learning applications. In this section, we'll focus on using aggregate features that are useful for generating baseline covariates that describe the cohort of interest. Additionally, we'll focus on the second two ways of constructing covariates: prespecified and custom analyses and leave using the default set as an exercise for the reader.

\hypertarget{cohort-instantiation}{%
\subsection{Cohort instantiation}\label{cohort-instantiation}}

We first need to instantiate the cohort to characterize it. Instantiating cohorts is described in Chapter \ref{Cohorts}. In this example, we'll use the persons initiating a first-line therapy for hypertension with 1 year follow up (\texttt{Appendix\ X}). We leave characterizing the other cohorts in \texttt{Appendix\ X} as an exercise for the reader. We will assume the cohort has been instantiated in a table called \texttt{scratch.my\_cohorts} with cohort definition ID equal to 1.

\hypertarget{data-extraction}{%
\subsection{Data extraction}\label{data-extraction}}

We first need to tell R how to connect to the server. FeatureExtraction uses the DatabaseConnector package, which provides a function called \texttt{createConnectionDetails}. Type \texttt{?createConnectionDetails} for the specific settings required for the various database management systems (DBMS). For example, one might connect to a PostgreSQL database using this code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(FeatureExtraction)}
\NormalTok{connDetails <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createConnectionDetails}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{dbms =} \StringTok{"postgresql"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{server =} \StringTok{"localhost/ohdsi"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{user =} \StringTok{"joe"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{password =} \StringTok{"supersecret"}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{cdmDbSchema <-}\StringTok{ "my_cdm_data"}
\NormalTok{cohortsDbSchema <-}\StringTok{ "scratch"}
\NormalTok{cohortsDbTable <-}\StringTok{ "my_cohorts"}
\NormalTok{cdmVersion <-}\StringTok{ "5"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The last four lines define the \texttt{cdmDbSchema}, \texttt{cohortsDbSchema}, and \texttt{cohortsDbTable} variables, as well as the CDM version. We will use these later to tell R where the data in CDM format live, where the cohorts of interest have been created, and what version CDM is used. Note that for Microsoft SQL Server, database schemas need to specify both the database and the schema, so for example \texttt{cdmDbSchema\ \textless{}-\ "my\_cdm\_data.dbo"}.

\hypertarget{using-prespecified-analyses}{%
\subsection{Using prespecified analyses}\label{using-prespecified-analyses}}

The function \texttt{createCovariateSettings} allow the user to choose from a large set of predefined covariates. Type \texttt{?createCovariateSettings} to get an overview of the available options. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{settings <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createCovariateSettings}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{useDemographicsGender =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{useDemographicsAgeGroup =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{useConditionOccurrenceAnyTimePrior =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This will create binary covariates for gender, age (in 5 year age groups), and each concept observed in the condition\_occurrence table any time prior to (and including) the cohort start date.

Many of the prespecified analyses refer to a short, medium, or long term time window. By default, these windows are defined as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Long term}: 365 days prior up to and including the cohort start date.
\item
  \textbf{Medium term}: 180 days prior up to and including the cohort start date.
\item
  \textbf{Short term}: 30 days prior up to and including the cohort start date.
\end{itemize}

However, the user can change these values. For example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{settings <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createCovariateSettings}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{useConditionEraLongTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{useConditionEraShortTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{useDrugEraLongTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                    \DataTypeTok{useDrugEraShortTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{longTermStartDays =} \DecValTok{-180}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{shortTermStartDays =} \DecValTok{-14}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{endDays =} \DecValTok{-1}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

This redefines the long term window as 180 days prior up to (but not including) the cohort start date, and redefines the short term window as 14 days prior up to (but not including) the cohort start date.

Again, we can also specify which concept IDs should or should not be used to construct covariates:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{settings <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createCovariateSettings}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{useConditionEraLongTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{useConditionEraShortTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{useDrugEraLongTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{useDrugEraShortTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{longTermStartDays =} \DecValTok{-180}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{shortTermStartDays =} \DecValTok{-14}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{endDays =} \DecValTok{-1}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{excludedCovariateConceptIds =} \DecValTok{1124300}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{addDescendantsToExclude =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{aggregated =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
IMPORTANT: the use of \texttt{aggregated\ =\ TRUE} for all of the examples above indicate to FeatureExtraction to provide summary statistics. Excluding this flag will compute covariates for each person in the cohort.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

\hypertarget{creating-aggregated-covariates}{%
\subsection{Creating aggregated covariates}\label{creating-aggregated-covariates}}

The following code block will generate aggregated statistics for a cohort:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{covariateSettings <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createDefaultCovariateSettings}\NormalTok{() }

\NormalTok{covariateData2 <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{getDbCovariateData}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{connectionDetails =}\NormalTok{ connectionDetails, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{cdmDatabaseSchema =}\NormalTok{ cdmDatabaseSchema, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{cohortDatabaseSchema =}\NormalTok{ resultsDatabaseSchema, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{cohortTable =} \StringTok{"cohorts_of_interest"}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{cohortId =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{covariateSettings =}\NormalTok{ covariateSettings, }
                                    \DataTypeTok{aggregated =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{) }

\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(covariateData2) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And the output will look similar to the following:

\begin{verbatim}
## CovariateData object summary 
## 
## Number of covariates: 41330 
## Number of non-zero covariate values: 41330
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{output-format}{%
\subsection{Output format}\label{output-format}}

The two main components of the aggregated \texttt{covariateData} object are \texttt{covariates} and \texttt{covariatesContinuous} for binary and continuous covariates respectively:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{covariateData2}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{covariates}
\NormalTok{covariateData2}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{covariatesContinuous}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{custom-covariates}{%
\subsection{Custom covariates}\label{custom-covariates}}

FeatureExtraction also provides the ability to define and utilize custom covariates. These details are an advanced topic and covered in the user documentation: \url{http://ohdsi.github.io/FeatureExtraction/}.

\hypertarget{cohort-pathways-in-atlas}{%
\section{Cohort pathways in ATLAS}\label{cohort-pathways-in-atlas}}

The goal with a pathway analysis is to understand the sequencing of treatments along in one or more cohorts of interest. The methods applied are based on the design reported by \citep{Hripcsak7329}. These methods were generalized and codified into a feature called Cohort Pathways in ATLAS.

Cohort pathways aims to provide analytic capabilities to summarize the events following the cohort start date of one or more target cohorts. To do this, we create a set of cohorts to identify the clinical events of interest for the target population called event cohort. Focusing on how this might look for a person in the target cohort:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/pathwaysPersonEventView} 

}

\caption{Pathways analysis in the context of a single person.}\label{fig:pathwaysPersonEventView}
\end{figure}

In the figure above, the person is part of the target cohort with a defined start and end date. Then, the numbered line segments represent where that person also is identified in an event cohort for a duration of time. Event cohorts allow us to describe any clinical event of interest that is represented in the CDM such that we are not constrained to creating a pathway for a single domain or concept.

To start, click on \includegraphics{images/Characterization/atlasPathwaysMenuItem.png} in the left bar of ATLAS to create a new cohort pathways study. Provide a descriptive name and press the save button .

\hypertarget{design-1}{%
\subsection{Design}\label{design-1}}

To start, we will continue to use the cohorts initiating a first-line therapy for hypertension with 1 and 3 years follow up (\texttt{Appendix\ X}). Use the button to import the 2 cohorts.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasPathwaysTargetCohorts} 

}

\caption{Pathways analysis with target cohorts selected.}\label{fig:atlasPathwaysTargetCohorts}
\end{figure}

Next we'll define the event cohorts by creating a cohort for each first-line hypertensive drug of interest. For this, we'll start by creating a cohort of ACE inhibitor users and define the cohort end date as the end of continuous exposure. We'll do the same for 8 other hypertensive medications and note that these definitions are found in \texttt{Appendix\ X}. Once complete use the \includegraphics{images/Characterization/atlasImportButton.png} button to import these into the Event Cohort section of the pathway design:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasPathwaysEventCohorts} 

}

\caption{Event cohorts for pathway design for initiating a first-line antihypertensive therapy.}\label{fig:atlasPathwaysEventCohorts}
\end{figure}

When complete, your design should look like the one above. Next, we'll need to decide on a few additional analysis settings:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Combination window}: This setting allows you to define a window of time, in days, in which overlap between events is considered a combination of events. For example, if two drugs represented by 2 event cohorts (event cohort 1 and event cohort 2) overlap within the combination window the pathways algorithm will combine them into ``event cohort 1 + event cohort 2''.
\item
  \textbf{Minimum cell count}: Event cohorts with less than this number of people will be censored (removed) from the output to protect privacy.
\item
  \textbf{Max path length}: This refers to the maximum number of sequential events to consider for the analysis.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{executions-1}{%
\subsection{Executions}\label{executions-1}}

Once we have our pathway analysis designed, we can execute this design against one or more CDMs in our environment. This works the same way as we described for cohort characterization in ATLAS. Once complete, we can review the results of the analysis.

\hypertarget{viewing-results}{%
\subsection{Viewing Results}\label{viewing-results}}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasPathwaysResults} 

}

\caption{Pathways results legend and sunburst visualization.}\label{fig:atlasPathwaysResults}
\end{figure}

The results of a pathway analysis are broken into 3 sections: The legend section displays the total number of persons in the target cohort along with the number of persons that had 1 or more events in the pathway analysis. Below that summary are the color designations for each of the cohorts that appear in the sunburst plot in the center section.

The sunburst plot is a visualization that represents the various event pathways taken by persons over time. The center of the plot represents the cohort entry and the first color-coded ring shows the proportion of persons in each event cohort. In our example, the center of the circle represents hypternsive persons initiating a first line therapy. Then, the first ring in the sunburst plot shows the proportion of persons that initiated a type of first-line therapy defined by the event cohorts (i.e.~ACE inhibitors, ARBs, etc). The second set of rings represents the 2nd event cohort for persons. In certain event sequences, a person may never have a 2nd event cohort observed in the data and that proportion is represented by the grey portion of the ring.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasPathwaysResultsPathDetails} 

}

\caption{Pathways results displaying path details.}\label{fig:atlasPathwaysResultsPathDetails}
\end{figure}

Clicking on a section of the sunburst plot will display the path details on the right. Here we can see that the largest proportion of people in our target cohort initiated a first-line therapy with ACE inhibitors and from that group, a smaller proportion started a Thiazide diuretic.

\hypertarget{incidence-analysis-in-atlas}{%
\section{Incidence analysis in ATLAS}\label{incidence-analysis-in-atlas}}

In an incidence calculation, we describe: amongst the persons in the target cohort, who experienced the outcome cohort during the time at risk period. Here we will design an incidence analysis to characterize angioedema and acute myocardial infarction outcomes amongst new users of ACE inhibitors and Thiazide-like diuretics. We will assess these outcomes during the time-at-risk that a person was exposed to the drug. Additionally, we will add an outcome of drug exposure to Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to measure the incidence of new use of ARBs during exposure to the target cohorts (ACEi and Thiazides). This outcome definition provides an understanding of how ARBs are utilized amongst the target populations.

To start, click on \includegraphics{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceMenuItem.png} in the left bar of ATLAS to create a new incidence analysis. Provide a descriptive name and press the save button \includegraphics{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/save.png}.

\hypertarget{design-2}{%
\subsection{Design}\label{design-2}}

We assume the cohorts used in this example have already been created in ATLAS as described in Chapter \ref{Cohorts}. The Appendix provides the full definitions of the target cohorts (\texttt{Appendix\ B.2,\ B.5}), and outcomes (\texttt{Appendix\ B.4\ and\ Appendix\ B.3,\ Appendix\ X\ for\ ARB\ Exposure}) cohorts.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceCohortSelection} 

}

\caption{Incidence Rate target and outcome definition.}\label{fig:atlasIncidenceCohortSelection}
\end{figure}

On the definition tab, click to choose the ACE inhibitor cohort and the Thiazide-like diuretics cohorts. Close the dialog to view that these cohorts are added to the design. Next we add our outcome cohorts by clicking on and from the dialog box, select the outcome cohorts of \emph{acute myocardial infarction events}, \emph{angioedema events} and \emph{Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use}. Again, close the window to view that these cohorts are added to the outcome cohorts section of the design.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceTimeAtRisk} 

}

\caption{Incidence Rate target and outcome definition.}\label{fig:atlasIncidenceTimeAtRisk}
\end{figure}

Next, we will define the time at risk window for the analysis. As shown above, the time at risk window is defined relative to the cohort start and end dates. Here we will define the time at risk start as 1 day after cohort start for our target cohorts. Next, we'll define the time at risk to end at the cohort end date. In this case, the definition of the ACE and Thiazide cohorts have a cohort end date when the drug exposure ends.

ATLAS also provides a way to stratify the target cohorts as part of the analysis specification:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceStratifyFemale} 

}

\caption{Incidence Rate strata definition for females.}\label{fig:atlasIncidenceStratifyFemale}
\end{figure}

To do this, click the New Stratify Criteria button and follow the same steps described in Chapter 11. Now that we have completed the design, we can move to executing our design against one or more data sources.

\hypertarget{executions-2}{%
\subsection{Executions}\label{executions-2}}

Click the Generation tab and then the button to reveal a list of data sources to use to execute the analysis:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceSourceSelection} 

}

\caption{Incidence Rate analysis execution.}\label{fig:atlasIncidenceSourceSelection}
\end{figure}

Select one or more data sources and click the Generate button to start the analysis to analyze all combinations of targets and outcomes specified in the design.

\hypertarget{viewing-results-1}{%
\subsection{Viewing Results}\label{viewing-results-1}}

On the Generation tab, the top portion of the screen allows you to select a target and outcome to use when viewing the results. Just below this a summary of the incidence is shown for each data source used in the analysis.

Select the target cohort of New ACEi users and the Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) from the respective dropdown lists. Click the \includegraphics{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceReportButton.png} button to reveal the incidence analysis results:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceResults} 

}

\caption{Incidence Rate analysis output - New ACEi users with AMI outcome.}\label{fig:atlasIncidenceResults}
\end{figure}

A summary for the data source shows the total persons in the cohort that were observed during the time-at-risk along with the total number of cases. The proportion shows the number of cases per 1000 people. The time at risk, in years, is calculated for the target cohort. The incidence rate is expressed as the number of cases per 1000 person years.

We can also view the incidence metrics for the strata that we defined in the design. The same metrics mentioned above are calculated for each strata. Additionally, a treemap visualization provides a representation of the proportion of each strata represented by the boxed areas. The color represents the incidence rate as shown in the scale along the bottom.

We can gather the same information to see the incidence of new use of ARBs amongst the ACEi population. Using the dropdown at the top, change the outcome to ARBs use and click the \includegraphics{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceReportButton.png} button to reveal the details.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/Characterization/atlasIncidenceResultsARB} 

}

\caption{Incidence Rate - New users of ACEi receiving ARBs treatment during ACEi exposure.}\label{fig:atlasIncidenceResultsARB}
\end{figure}

As shown, the metrics calculated are the same but the interpretation is different since the input (ARB use) references a drug utilization estimate instead of a health outcome.

\hypertarget{summary-6}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-6}}

Characterization aims to answer describe populations of interest to understand the who, what, when and where associated to their medical experience. These descriptive statistics generate evidence to inform the disease natural history, treatment utilization and quality improvement.

\hypertarget{exercises-4}{%
\section{Exercises}\label{exercises-4}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We would like to understand how hypertensive treatments are utilized in a real world setting. To start, we would like to understand the composition of data that a source has for a hypertensive medication such as Lisinopril. How would you use ATLAS data source module to find information on Lisinopril?
\item
  In the chapter we characterized new users of any hypertensive medication and utilized the cohort pathways tool in ATLAS to find that ACE Inhibitors and Thiazides were the most commonly used first-line drug therapy. To better understand the disease natural history of patients initiating ACE inhibitors and Thiazides, use ATLAS to construct a cohort characterization for these populations to understand their demographics, concomitant medications and comorbid conditions.
\item
  In the chapter, we used the cohort pathways module ATLAS to characterize treatment sequences of hypternsive drugs. How might we use the same approach to characterize procedure sequences used to treat hypertension (i.e.~cardiac bypass surgery, carotid artery surgery and dialysis)?
\item
  Using the preceding conditions found in exercise \#2, construct an incidence rate analysis to find the rate of an outcome in the ACEi and Thiazide populations.

\hypertarget{PopulationLevelEstimation}{%
\chapter{Population-level estimation}\label{PopulationLevelEstimation}}

\emph{Chapter leads: Martijn Schuemie, David Madigan, Marc Suchard \& Patrick Ryan}

\index{population-level estimation}

Observational healthcare data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, offer opportunities to generate real-world evidence about the effect of treatments that can meaningfully improve the lives of patients. In this chapter we focus on population-level effect estimation, that is, the estimation of average causal effects of exposures (e.g.~medical interventions such as drug exposures or procedures) on specific health outcomes of interest. In what follows, we consider two different estimation tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Direct effect estimation}: estimating the effect of an exposure on the risk of an outcome, as compared to no exposure. \index{direct effect estimation}
\item
  \textbf{Comparative effect estimation}: estimating the effect of an exposure (the target exposure) on the risk of an outcome, as compared to another exposure (the comparator exposure). \index{comparative effect estimation}
\end{itemize}

In both cases, the patient-level causal effect contrasts a factual outcome, i.e., what happened to the exposed patient, with a counterfactual outcome, i.e., what would have happened had the exposure not occurred (direct) or had a different exposure occurred (comparative). Since any one patient reveals only the factual outcome (the fundamental problem of causal inference), the various effect estimation designs employ different analytic devices to shed light on the counterfactual outcomes. \index{counterfactual}

Use-cases for population-level effect estimation include treatment selection, safety surveillance, and comparative effectiveness. Methods can test specific hypotheses one-at-a-time (e.g.~`signal evaluation') or explore multiple-hypotheses-at-once (e.g.~`signal detection'). In all cases, the objective remains the same: to produce a high-quality estimate of the causal effect. \index{safety surveillance} \index{comparative effectiveness|see {comparative effect estimation}}

In this chapter we first describe various population-level estimation study designs, all of which are implemented as R packages in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}{OHDSI Methods Library}. We then detail the design of an example estimation study, followed by step-by-step guides of how to implement the design using ATLAS and R. Finally, we review the various outputs generated by the study, including study diagnostics and effect size estimates.

\hypertarget{CohortMethod}{%
\section{The cohort method design}\label{CohortMethod}}

\index{cohort method}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/cohortMethod} 

}

\caption{The new-user cohort design. Subjects observed to initiate the target treatment are compared to those initiating the comparator treatment. To adjust for differences between the two treatment groups several adjustment strategies can be used, such as stratification, matching, or weighting by the propensity score, or by adding baseline characateristcs to the outcome model. The chararacteristics included in the propensity model or outcome model are captured prior to treatment initiation.}\label{fig:cohortMethod}
\end{figure}

The cohort method attempts to emulate a randomized clinical trial \citep{hernan_2016}. Subjects that are observed to initiate one treatment (the target) are compared to subjects initiating another treatment (the comparator) and are followed for a specific amount of time following treatment initiation, for example the time they stay on the treatment. We can specify the questions we wish to answer in a cohort study by making the five choices highlighted in Table \ref{tab:cmChoices}. \index{target cohort!cohort method} \index{comparator cohort} \index{outcome cohort!cohort method}

The choice of model specifies, among others, the type of model. For example, we could use a logistic regression, which evaluates whether or not the outcome has occurred, and produces an odds ratio. A logistic regression assumes the time-at-risk is of the same length for both target and comparator, or is irrelevant. Alternatively, we could choose a Poisson regression which estimates the incidence rate ratio, assuming a constant incidence rate. Often a Cox regression is used which considers time to first outcome to estimate the hazard ratio, assuming proportional hazards between target and comparator. \index{logistic regression} \index{Poisson regression} \index{Cox regression} \index{Cox proportional hazards model|see {Cox regression}}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
The new-user cohort method inherently is a method for comparative effect estimation, comparing one treatment to another. It is difficult to use this method to compare a treatment against no treatment, since it is hard to define a group of unexposed people that is comparable with the exposed group. If one wants to use this design for direct effect estimation, the preferred way is to select a comparator treatment for the same indication as the exposure of interest, where the comparator treatment is believed to have no effect on the outcome. Unfortunately, such a comparator might not always be available.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

A key concern is that the patients receiving the target treatment may systematically differ from those receiving the comparator treatment. For example, suppose the target cohort is, on average, 60 years old, whereas the comparator cohort is on average 40 years old. Comparing target to comparator with respect to any age-related health outcome (e.g.~stroke) might then show substantial differences. An uninformed investigator might reach the conclusion there is a causal association between the target treatment and stroke as compared to the comparator. More prosaically or commonplace, the investigator might conclude that there exist target patients that experienced stroke that would not have done so had they received the comparator. This conclusion could well be entirely incorrect! Maybe those target patients disproportionately experienced stroke simply because they are older; maybe the target patients that experienced stroke might well have done so even if they had received the comparator. In this context, age is a ``confounder''. \index{confounder}

\hypertarget{propensity-scores}{%
\subsection{Propensity scores}\label{propensity-scores}}

\index{propensity score}

In a randomized trial, a (virtual) coin toss assigns patients to their respective groups. Thus, by design, the probability that a patient receives the target treatment as against the comparator treatment does not relate in any way to patient characteristics such as age. The coin has no knowledge of the patient, and, what's more, we know with certainty the exact probability that a patient receives the target exposure. As a consequence, and with increasing confidence as the number of patients in the trial increases, the two groups of patients essentially \emph{cannot} differ systematically with respect to \emph{any} patient characteristic. This guaranteed balance holds true for characteristics that the trial measured (such as age) as well as characteristics that the trial failed to measure. \index{randomized trial}

For a given patient, the \emph{propensity score} (PS) is the probability that that patient received the target treatment as against the comparator. \citep{rosenbaum_1983} In a balanced two-arm randomized trial, the propensity score is 0.5 for every patient. In a propensity score-adjusted observational study, we estimate the probability of a patient receiving the target treatment based on what we can observe in the data on and before the time of treatment initiation (irrespective of the treatment they actually received). This a straightforward predictive modeling application; we fit a model (e.g.~a logistic regression) that predicts whether a subject receives the target treatment, and use this model to generate predicted probabilities (the PS) for each subject. Unlike in a standard randomized trial, different patients will have different probabilities of receiving the target treatment. The PS can be used in several ways, for example by matching target subjects to comparator subjects with similar PS, by stratifying the study population based on the PS, or by weighting subjects using Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) derived from the PS. When matching we can select just one comparator subject for each target subject, or we can allow more than one comparator subject per target subject, a technique know as variable-ratio matching. \citep{rassen_2012} \index{propensity model} \index{propensity score!matching} \index{propensity score!stratification} \index{propensity score!weighting} \index{inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)|see {propensity score!weighting}} \index{variable ratio matching}

For example, suppose we use one-on-one PS matching, and that Jan has a priori probability of 0.4 of receiving the target treatment and in fact receives the target treatment. If we can find a patient (named Jun) that also had an a priori probability of 0.4 of receiving the target treatment but in fact received the comparator, the comparison of Jan and Jun's outcomes is like a mini-randomized trial, at least with respect to measured confounders. This comparison will yield an estimate of the Jan-Jun causal contrast that is as good as the one randomization would have produced. Estimation then proceeds as follows: for every patient that received the target, find one or more matched patients that received the comparator but had the same a priori probability of receiving the target. Compare the outcome for the target patient with the outcomes for the comparator patients within each of these matched groups.

Propensity scoring controls for measured confounders. In fact, if treatment assignment is ``strongly ignorable'' given measured characteristics, propensity scoring will yield an unbiased estimate of the causal effect. ``Strongly ignorable'' essentially means that there are no unmeasured confounders, and that the measured confounders are adjusted for appropriately. Unfortunately this is not a testable assumption. See Chapter \ref{MethodValidity} for further discussion of this issue. \index{strongly ignorable}

\hypertarget{VariableSelection}{%
\subsection{Variable selection}\label{VariableSelection}}

In the past, PS were computed based on manually selected characteristics, and although the OHDSI tools can support such practices, we prefer using many generic characteristics (i.e.~characteristics that are not selected based on the specific exposures and outcomes in the study). \citep{tian_2018} These characteristics include demographics, as well as all diagnoses, drug exposures, measurement, and medical procedures observed prior to and on the day of treatment initiation. A model typically involves 10,000 to 100,000 unique characteristics, which we fit using large-scale regularized regression \citep{suchard_2013} implemented in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/Cyclops/}{Cyclops} package. In essence, we let the data appropriately weigh the characteristics.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
We typically include the day of treatment initiation in the covariate capture window because many relevant data points such as the diagnosis leading to the treatment are recorded on that date. This does require us to explicitly exclude the target and comparator treatment from the set of covariates, because these are the things we are trying to predict.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

Some have argued that a data-driven approach to covariate selection that does not depend on clinical expertise to specify the ``right'' causal structure runs the risk of erroneously including so-called instrumental variables and colliders, thus increasing variance and potentially introducing bias. \citep{hernan_2002} However, these concerns are unlikely to have a large impact in real-world scenarios. \citep{schneeweiss_2018} Furthermore, in medicine the true causal structure is rarely known, and when different researchers are asked to identify the `right' covariates to include for a specific research question, each researcher invariably comes up with a different list, thus making the process irreproducible. Most importantly, our diagnostics such as inspection of the propensity model, evaluating balance on all covariates, and including negative controls would identify most problems related to colliders and instrumental variables. \index{instrumental variables} \index{colliders}

\hypertarget{caliper}{%
\subsection{Caliper}\label{caliper}}

\index{caliper}

Since propensity scores fall on a continuum from 0 to 1, exact matching is rarely possible. Instead, the matching process finds patients that match the propensity score of a target patient(s) within some tolerance known as a ``caliper.'' Following \citet{austin_2011}, we use a default caliper of 0.2 standard deviations on the logit scale.

\hypertarget{overlap-preference-scores}{%
\subsection{Overlap: preference scores}\label{overlap-preference-scores}}

\index{preference score}

The propensity method requires that matching patients exist! As such, a key diagnostic shows the distribution of the propensity scores in the two groups. To facilitate interpretation, the OHDSI tools plot a transformation of the propensity score called the ``preference score''. \citep{walker_2013} The preference score adjusts for the ``market share'' of the two treatments. For example, if 10\% of patients receive the target treatment (and 90\% receive the comparator treatment), then patients with a preference score of 0.5 have a 10\% probability of receiving the target treatment. Mathematically, the preference score is

\[\ln\left(\frac{F}{1-F}\right)=\ln\left(\frac{S}{1-S}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{P}{1-P}\right)\]

Where \(F\) is the preference score, \(S\) is the propensity score, and \(P\) is the proportion of patients receiving the target treatment.

\citet{walker_2013} discuss the concept of ``empirical equipoise''. They accept exposure pairs as emerging from empirical equipoise if at least half of the exposures are to patients with a preference score of between 0.3 and 0.7. \index{clinical equipoise}

\hypertarget{balance}{%

\index{covariate balance} \index{balance|see {covariate balance}}

Good practice always checks that the PS adjustment succeeds in creating balanced groups of patients. Figure \ref{fig:balance} shows the standard OHDSI output for checking balance. For each patient characteristic, this plots the standardized difference between means between the two exposure groups before and after PS adjustment. Some guidelines recommend an after-adjustment standardized difference upper bound of 0.1. \citep{rubin_2001}

Because the same subject that make up the exposed group are also used as the control group, no adjustment for between-person differences need to be made. However, the method is vulnerable to other differences, such as differences in the baseline risk of the outcome between different time periods.

Since cases serve as their own control, it is a self-controlled design, and should therefore be robust to confounding due to between-person differences. One concern is that, because the outcome date is always later than the control date, the method will be positively biased if the overall frequency of exposure increases over time (or negatively biased if there is a decrease). To address this, the case-time-control design \citep{suissa_1995} was developed, which adds controls, matched for example on age and sex, to the case-crossover design to adjust for exposure trends. \index{case-time-control design}

Like other self-controlled designs, the SCCS is robust to confounding due to between-person differences, but vulnerable to confounding due to time-varying effects. Several adjustments are possible to attempt to account for these, for example by including age and season. A special variant of the SCCS includes not just the exposure of interest, but all other exposures to drugs recorded in the database, \citep{simpson_2013} potentially adding thousands of additional variables to the model. L1-regularization using cross-validation to select the regularization hyperparameter is applied to the coefficients of all exposures except the exposure of interest.

One important assumption underlying the SCCS is that the observation period end is independent of the date of the outcome. Because for some outcomes, especially ones that can be fatal such as stroke, this assumption can be violated. An extension to the SCCS has been developed that corrects for any such dependency. \citep{farrington_2011}

\hypertarget{problem-definition-1}{%
\subsection{Problem definition}\label{problem-definition-1}}

ACE inhibitors (ACEi) are widely used in patients with hypertension or ischemic heart disease, especially those with other comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease. \citep{zaman_2002} Angioedema, a serious and sometimes life-threatening adverse event that usually manifests as swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth, larynx, pharynx, or periorbital region, has been linked to the use of these medications. \citep{sabroe_1997} However, limited information is available about the absolute and relative risks for angioedema associated with the use of these medications. Existing evidence is primarily based on investigations of specific cohorts (e.g., predominantly male veterans or Medicaid beneficiaries), whose findings may not be generalizable to other populations, or based on investigations with few events, which provide unstable risk estimates \citep{powers_2012}. Several observational studies compare ACEi to beta-blockers for the risk of angioedema, \citep{magid_2010, toh_2012} but beta-blockers are no longer recommend as first-line treatment of hypertension. \citep{whelton_2018} A viable alternative treatment could be thiazides or thiazide-like diuretics (THZ), which could be just as effective in managing hypertension and its associated risks such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but without increasing the risk of angioedema.

The following will demonstrate how to apply our population-level estimation framework to observational healthcare data to address the following comparative estimation questions:

\begin{quote}
What is the risk of angioedema in new users of ACE inhibitors compared to new users of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics?
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What is the risk of acute myocaridal infarction in new users of ACE inhibitors compared to new users of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics?
\end{quote}

Since these are comparative effect estimation questions we will apply the cohort method as described in Section \ref{CohortMethod}.

We consider patients new-users if their first observed treatment for hypertension was monotherapy with any active ingredient in either the ACEi or THZ class. We define mono therapy as not starting on any other anti-hypertensive drug in the seven days following treatment initiation. We require patients to have at least one year of prior continuous observation in the database before first exposure and a recorded hypertension diagnosis at or in the year preceding treatment initiation.

\hypertarget{outcome-1}{%

We define angioedema as any occurrence of an angioedema condition concept during an inpatient or emergency room (ER) visit, and require there to be no angioedema diagnosis recorded in the seven days prior.

The Appendix provides the full definitions of the target (Appendix \ref{AceInhibitorsMono}), comparator (Appendix \ref{ThiazidesMono}), and outcome (Appendix \ref{Angioedema} and Appendix \ref{Ami}) cohorts. When done, the dialog should look like Figure \ref{fig:comparisons}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/comparisons} 

}

\caption{The comparison dialog}\label{fig:comparisons}
\end{figure}

Note that we can select multiple outcomes for a target-comparator pair. Each outcome will be treated independently, and will result in a separate analysis.

\textbf{Negative control outcomes}

Negative controls outcomes are outcomes that are not believed to be caused by either the target or the comparator, and where therefore the true hazard ratio equals 1. Ideally, we would have proper cohort definitions for each outcome cohort. However, typically, we only have a concept set, with one concept per negative control outcome, and some standard logic to turn these into outcome cohorts. Here we assume the concept set has already been created as described in Chapter \ref{MethodValidity} and can simply be selected. The negative control concept set should contain a concept per negative control, and not include descendants. Figure \ref{fig:ncConceptSet} shows the negative control concept set used for this study.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/ncConceptSet} 

}

\caption{Negative Control concept set.}\label{fig:ncConceptSet}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Concepts to include}

TODO: Update these sections when ATLAS interface has been updated.

When selecting concept to include, we can specify which covariates we would like to generate, for example to use in a propensity model. When specifying covariates here, all other covariates (aside from those you specified) are left out. We usually want to include all baseline covariates, letting the regularized regression build a model that balances all covariates. The only reason we might want to specify particular covariates is to replicate an existing study that manually picked covariates. These inclusions can be specified in this comparison section or in the analysis section, because sometimes they pertain to a specific comparison (e.g.~know confounders in a comparison), or sometimes they pertain to an analysis (e.g.~when evaluating a particular covariate selection strategy).

\textbf{Concepts to exclude}

Rather than specifying which concepts to include, we can instead specify concepts to \emph{exclude}. When we submit a concept set in this field, we use every covariate except for those that we submitted. When using the default set of covariates, which includes all drugs and procedures occurring on the day of treatment initiation, we must exclude the target and comparator treatment, and any concepts that are directly related to these. For example, if the target exposure is an injectable, we should not only exclude the drug, but also the injection procedure from the propensity model. In this example, the covariates we want to exclude are ACEi and THZ. Figure \ref{fig:covsToExclude} shows we select a concept set that includes all these concepts.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/covsToExclude} 

}

\caption{The concept set defining the concepts to exclude.}\label{fig:covsToExclude}
\end{figure}

After selecting the negative controls and covariates to exclude, the lower half of the comparisons dialog should look like Figure \ref{fig:comparisons2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/comparisons2} 

}

\caption{The comparison window showing concept sets for negative controls and concepts to exclude.}\label{fig:comparisons2}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{effect-estimation-analysis-settings}{%
\subsection{Effect estimation analysis settings}\label{effect-estimation-analysis-settings}}

After closing the comparisons dialog we can click on ``Add Analysis Settings''. In the box labeled ``Analysis Name'', we can give the analysis a unique name that is easy to remember and locate in the future. For example, we could set the name to ``Propensity score matching''.

\textbf{Study population}

There are a wide range of options to specify the study population; the set of subjects that will enter the analysis. Many of these overlap with options available when designing the target and comparator cohorts in the cohort definition tool. One reason for using the options in Estimation instead of in the cohort definition is re-usability: We can define the target, comparator, and outcome cohorts completely independently, and add dependencies between these at a later point in time. For example, if we wish to remove people who had the outcome before treatment initiation, we could do so in the definitions of the target and comparator cohort, but then we would need to create separate cohorts for every outcome! Instead, we can choose to have people with prior outcomes be removed in the analysis settings, and now we can reuse our target and comparator cohorts for our two outcomes of interest (as well as our negative control outcomes).

The \textbf{study start and end dates} can be used to limit the analyses to a specific period. The study end date also truncates risk windows, meaning no outcomes beyond the study end date will be considered. One reason for selecting a study start date might be that one of the drugs being studied is new and did not exist in an earlier time. Automatically adjusting for this can be done by answering ``yes'' to the question ``\textbf{Restrict the analysis to the period when both exposures are observed?}''. Another reason to adjust study start and end dates might be that medical practice changed over time (e.g., due to a drug warning) and we are only interested in the time where medicine was practiced a specific way.

The option ``\textbf{Should only the first exposure per subject be included?}'' can be used to restrict to the first exposure per patient. Often this is already done in the cohort definition, as is the case in this example. Similarly, the option ``\textbf{The minimum required continuous observation time prior to index date for a person to be included in the cohort}'' is often already set in the cohort definition, and can therefore be left at 0 here. Having observed time (as defined in the OBSERVATION\_PERIOD table) before the index date ensures that there is sufficient information about the patient to calculate a propensity score, and is also often used to ensure the patient is truly a new user, and therefore was not exposed before.

``\textbf{Remove subjects that are in both the target and comparator cohort?}'' defines, together with the option ``\textbf{If a subject is in multiple cohorts, should time-at-risk be censored when the new time-at-risk starts to prevent overlap?}'' what happens when a subject is in both target and comparator cohort. The first setting has three choices:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``\textbf{Keep All}'' indicating to keep the subjects in both cohorts. With this option it might be possible to double-count subjects and outcomes.
\item
  ``\textbf{Keep First}'' indicating to keep the subject in the first cohort that occurred.
\item
  ``\textbf{Remove All}'' indicating to remove the subject from both cohorts.
\end{itemize}

If the options ``keep all'' or ``keep first'' are selected, we may wish to censor the time when a person is in both cohorts. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:tar}. By default, the time-at-risk is defined relative to the cohort start and end date. In this example, the time-at-risk starts one day after cohort entry, and stops at cohort end. Without censoring the time-at-risk for the two cohorts might overlap. This is especially problematic if we choose to keep all, because any outcome that occurs during this overlap (as shown) will be counted twice. If we choose to censor, the first cohort's time-at-risk ends when the second cohort's time-at-risk starts.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/tar} 

}

\caption{Time-at-risk (TAR) for subjects who are in both cohorts, assuming time-at-risk starts the day after treatment initiation, and stops at exposure end.}\label{fig:tar}
\end{figure}

We can choose to \textbf{remove subjects that have the outcome prior to the risk window start}, because often a second outcome occurrence is the continuation of the first one. For instance, when someone develops heart failure, a second occurrence is likely, which means the heart failure probably never fully resolved in between. On the other hand, some outcomes are episodic, and it would be expected for patients to have more than one independent occurrence, like an upper respiratory infection. If we choose to remove people that had the outcome before, we can select \textbf{how many days we should look back when identifying prior outcomes}.

Our choices for our example study are shown in Figure \ref{fig:studyPopulation}. Because our target and comparator cohort definitions already restrict to the first exposure and require observation time prior to treatment initiation, we do not apply these criteria here.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/studyPopulation} 

}

\caption{Study population settings..}\label{fig:studyPopulation}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Covariate settings}

Here we specify the covariates to construct. These covariates are typically used in the propensity model, but can also be included in the outcome model (the Cox proporitional hazards model in this case). If we \textbf{click to view details} of our covariate settings, we can select which sets of covariates to construct. However, the recommendation is to use the default set, which constructs covariates for demographics, all conditions, drugs, procedures, measurements, etc.

We can modify the set of covariates by specifying concepts to \textbf{include} and/or \textbf{exclude}. These settings are the same as the ones found in Section \ref{ComparisonSettings} on comparison settings. The reason why they can be found in two places is because sometimes these settings are related to a specific comparison, as is the case here because we wish to exclude the drugs we are comparing, and sometimes the settings are related to a specific analysis. When executing an analysis for a specific comparison using specific analysis settings, the OHDSI tools will take the union of these sets.

The choice to \textbf{add descendants to include or exclude} affects this union of the two settings. So in this example we specified only the ingredients to exclude when defining the comparisons. Here we set ``Should descendant concepts be added to the list of excluded concepts?'' to ``Yes'' to also add all descendants.

Figure \ref{fig:covariateSettings} shows our choices for this study. Note that we have selected to add descendants to the concept to exclude, which we defined in the comparison settings in Figure \ref{fig:comparisons2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/covariateSettings} 

}

\caption{Covariate settings.}\label{fig:covariateSettings}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Time at risk}

Time-at-risk is defined relative to the start and end dates of our target and comparator cohorts. In our example, we had set the cohort start date to start on treatment initiation, and cohort end date when exposure stops (for at least 30 days). We set the start of time-at-risk to one day after cohort start, so one day after treatment initiation. A reason to set the time-at-risk start to be later than the cohort start is because we may want to exclude outcome events that occur on the day of treatment initiation if we do not believe it biologically plausible they can be caused by the drug.

We set the end of the time-at-risk to the cohort end, so when exposure stops. We could choose to set the end date later if for example we believe events closely following treatment end may still be attributable to the exposure. In the extreme we could set the time-at-risk end to a large number of days (e.g.~99999) after the cohort end date, meaning we will effectively follow up subjects until observation end. Such a design is sometimes referred to as an \emph{intent-to-treat} design.

A patient with zero days at risk adds no information, so the \textbf{minimum days at risk} is normally set at one day. If there is a known latency for the side effect, then this may be increased to get a more informative proportion. It can also be used to create a cohort more similar to that of a randomized trial it is being compared to (e.g., all the patients in the randomized trial were observed for at least N days).

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
A golden rule in designing a cohort study is to never use information that falls after the cohort start date to define the study population, as this may introduce bias. For example, if we require everyone to have at least a year of time-at-risk, we will likely have limited our analyses to those who tolerate the treatment well. This setting should therefore be used with extreme care.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/timeAtRisk} 

}

\caption{Time-at-risk settings.}\label{fig:timeAtRisk}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Propensity score adjustment}

We can opt to \textbf{trim} the study population, removing people with extreme PS values. We can choose to remove the top and bottom percentage, or we can remove subjects whose preference score falls outside the range we specify. Trimming the cohorts is generally not recommended because it requires discarding observations, which reduces statistical power. It may be desirable to trim in some cases, for example when using IPTW. \index{propensity score!trimming}

In addition to, or instead of trimming, we can choose to \textbf{stratify} or \textbf{match} on the propensity score. When stratifying we need to specify the \textbf{number of strata} and whether to select the strata based on the target, comparator, or entire study population. When matching we need to specify the \textbf{maximum number of people from the comparator group to match to each person in the target group}. Typical values are 1 for one-on-one matching, or a large number (e.g.~100) for variable-ratio matching. We also need to specify the \textbf{caliper}: the maximum allowed difference between propensity scores to allow a match. The caliper can be defined on difference \textbf{caliper scales}: \index{caliper!scale}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{The propensity score scale}: the PS itself
\item
  \textbf{The standardized scale}: in standard deviations of the PS distributions
\item
  \textbf{The standardized logit scale}: in standard deviations of the PS distributions after the logit transformation to make the PS more normally distributed.
\end{itemize}

In case of doubt, we suggest using the default values, or consult the work on this topic by \citet{austin_2011}.

Fitting large-scale propensity models can be computationally expensive, so we may want to restrict the data used to fit the model to just a sample of the data. By default the maximum size of the target and comparator cohort is set to 250,000. In most studies this limit will not be reached. It is also unlikely that more data will lead to a better model. Note that although a sample of the data may be used to fit the model, the model will be used to compute PS for the entire population.

\textbf{Test each covariate for correlation with the target assignment?} If any covariate has an unusually high correlation (either positive or negative), this will throw an error. This avoids lengthy calculation of a propensity model only to discover complete separation. Finding very high univariate correlation allows you to review the covariate to determine why it has high correlation and whether it should be dropped.

Figure \ref{fig:psSettings} shows our choices for this study. Note that we select variable-ratio matching by setting the maximum number of people to match to 100.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/psSettings} 

}

\caption{Propenstity score adjustment settings.}\label{fig:psSettings}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Outcome model settings}

First, we need to \textbf{specify the statistical model we will use to estimate the relative risk of the outcome between target and comparator cohorts}. We can choose between Cox, Poisson, and logistic regression, as discussed briefly in Section \ref{CohortMethod}. For our example we choose a Cox proportional hazards model, which considers time to first event with possible censoring. Next, we need to specify \textbf{whether the regression should be conditioned on the strata}. One way to understand conditioning is to imagine a separate estimate is produced in each stratum, and then combined across strata. For one-to-one matching this is likely unnecessary and would just lose power. For stratification or variable-ratio matching it is required. \index{conditioned model} \index{stratified model|see {conditioned model}}

We can also choose to \textbf{add all covariates to the outcome model} to adjust the analysis. This can be done in addition or instead of using a propensity model. However, whereas there usually is ample data to fit a propensity model, with many people in both treatment groups, there is typically very little data to fit the outcome model, with only few people having the outcome. We therefore recommend keeping the outcome model as simple as possible and not include additional covariates.

Instead of stratifying or matching on the propensity score we can also choose to \textbf{use inverse probability of treatment weighting} (IPTW). If weighting is used it is often recommended to use some form of trimming to avoid extreme weights and therefore unstable estimates.

Figure \ref{fig:psSettings} shows our choices for this study. Because we use variable-ratio matching, we must condition the regression on the strata (i.e.~the matched sets).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/outcomeModelSettings} 

}

\caption{Outcome model settings.}\label{fig:outcomeModelSettings}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{evaluationSettings}{%
\subsection{Evaluation settings}\label{evaluationSettings}}

As described in Chapter \ref{MethodValidity}, negative and positive controls should be included in our study to evaluate the operating characteristics, and perform empirical calibration.

\textbf{Negative control outcome cohort definition}

In Section \ref{ComparisonSettings} we selected a concept set representing the negative control outcomes. However, we need logic to convert concepts to cohorts to be used as outcomes in our analysis. ATLAS provides standard logic with three choices The first choice is whether to \textbf{use all occurrences} or just the \textbf{first occurrence} of the concept. The second choice determines \textbf{whether occurrences of descendant concepts should be considered}. For example, occurrences of the descendant ``ingrown nail of foot'' can also be counted as an occurrence of the ancestor ``ingrown nail''. The third choice specifies which domains should be considered when looking for the concepts.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/ncSettings} 

}

\caption{Negative control outcome cohort definition settings.}\label{fig:ncSettings}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Positive control synthesis}

In addition to negative controls we can also include positive controls, which are exposure-outcome pairs where a causal effect is believed to exist with known effect size. For various reasons real positive controls are problematic, so instead we rely on synthetic positive controls, derived from negative controls as described in Chapter \ref{MethodValidity}. Positive control synthesis is an advanced topic that we will skip for now.

TODO: Add positive control synthesis settings when ATLAS interface is updated.

\hypertarget{running-the-study-package}{%
\subsection{Running the study package}\label{running-the-study-package}}

Now that we have fully defined our study, we can export it as an executable R package. This package contains everything that is needed to execute the study at a site that has data in CDM. This includes the cohort definitions that can be used to instantiate the target, comparator and outcome cohorts, the negative control concept set and logic to create the negative control outcome cohorts, as well as the R code to execute the analysis. Before generating the package make sure to save your study, then click on the \textbf{Utilities} tab. Here we can review the set of analyses that will be performed. As mentioned before, every combination of a comparison and an analysis setting will results in a separate analysis. In our example we have specified two analyses: ACEi versus THZ for AMI, and ACEi versus THZ for angioedema, both using propensity score matching.

We must provide a name for our package, after which we can click on ``Download'' to download the zip file. The zip file contains an R package, with the usual required folder structure for R packages. \citep{Wickham_2015} To use this package we recommend using R Studio. If you are running R Studio locally, unzip the file, and double click the .Rproj file to open it in R Studio. If you are running R Studio on an R studio server, click \includegraphics{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/upload.png} to upload and unzip the file, then click on the .Rproj file to open the project.

Once you have opened the project in R Studio, you can open the README file, and follow the instructions. Make sure to change all file paths to existing paths on your system.

A common error message that may appear when running the study is ``High correlation between covariate(s) and treatment detected''. This indicates that when fitting the propensity model, some covariates were observed to be highly correlated with the exposure. Please review the covariates mentioned in the error message, and exclude them from the set of covariates if appropriate (see Section \ref{VariableSelection}). \index{high correlation}

\hypertarget{pleR}{%
\section{Implementing the study using R}\label{pleR}}

Instead of using ATLAS to write the R code that executes the study, we can also write the R code ourselves. One reason we might want to do this is because R offers far greater flexibility than is exposed in ATLAS. If we for example wish to use custom covariates, or a linear outcome model, we will need to write some custom R code, and combine it with the functionality provided by the OHDSI R packages.

For our example study we will rely on the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortMethod/}{CohortMethod} package to execute our study. CohortMethod extracts the necessary data from a database in the CDM and can use a large set of covariates for the propensity model. In the following example we first only consider angioedema as outcome. In Section \ref{MultipleAnalyses} we then describe how this can be extended to include AMI and the negative control outcomes.

\hypertarget{cohort-instantiation-1}{%
\subsection{Cohort instantiation}\label{cohort-instantiation-1}}

We first need to instantiate the target and outcome cohorts. Instantiating cohorts is described in Chapter \ref{Cohorts}. The Appendix provides the full definitions of the target (Appendix \ref{AceInhibitorsMono}), comparator (Appendix \ref{ThiazidesMono}), and outcome (Appendix \ref{Angioedema} ) cohorts. We will assume the ACEi, THZ, and angioedema cohorts have been instantiated in a table called \texttt{scratch.my\_cohorts} with cohort definition IDs 1,2, and 3 respectively.

\hypertarget{data-extraction-1}{%
\subsection{Data extraction}\label{data-extraction-1}}

We first need to tell R how to connect to the server. \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortMethod/}{CohortMethod} uses the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/}{DatabaseConnector} package, which provides a function called \texttt{createConnectionDetails}. Type \texttt{?createConnectionDetails} for the specific settings required for the various database management systems (DBMS). For example, one might connect to a PostgreSQL database using this code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(CohortMethod)}
\NormalTok{connDetails <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createConnectionDetails}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{dbms =} \StringTok{"postgresql"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{server =} \StringTok{"localhost/ohdsi"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{user =} \StringTok{"joe"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{password =} \StringTok{"supersecret"}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{cdmDbSchema <-}\StringTok{ "my_cdm_data"}
\NormalTok{cohortDbSchema <-}\StringTok{ "scratch"}
\NormalTok{cohortTable <-}\StringTok{ "my_cohorts"}
\NormalTok{cdmVersion <-}\StringTok{ "5"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The last four lines define the \texttt{cdmDbSchema}, \texttt{cohortDbSchema}, and \texttt{cohortTable} variables, as well as the CDM version. We will use these later to tell R where the data in CDM format live, where the cohorts of interest have been created, and what version CDM is used. Note that for Microsoft SQL Server, database schemas need to specify both the database and the schema, so for example \texttt{cdmDbSchema\ \textless{}-\ "my\_cdm\_data.dbo"}.

Now we can tell CohortMethod to extract the cohorts, construct covariates, and extract all necessary data for our analysis:

There are many parameters, but they are all documented in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortMethod/reference/}{CohortMethod manual}. The \texttt{createDefaultCovariateSettings} function is described in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/FeatureExtraction/}{FeatureExtraction} package. In short, we are pointing the function to the table containing our cohorts and specify which cohort definition IDs in that table identify the target, comparator and outcome. We instruct that the default set of covariates should be constructed, including covariates for all conditions, drug exposures, and procedures that were found on or before the index date. As mentioned in Section \ref{CohortMethod} we must exclude the target and comparator treatments from the set of covariates, and here we achieve this by listing all ingredients in the two classes, and tell FeatureExtraction to also exclude all descendants, thus excluding all drugs that contain these ingredients.

All data about the cohorts, outcomes, and covariates are extracted from the server and stored in the \texttt{cohortMethodData} object. This object uses the package \texttt{ff} to store information in a way that ensures R does not run out of memory, even when the data are large, as mentioned in Section \ref{BigDataSupport}.

We can use the generic \texttt{summary()} function to view some more information of the data we extracted:

Creating the \texttt{cohortMethodData} file can take considerable computing time, and it is probably a good idea to save it for future sessions. Because \texttt{cohortMethodData} uses \texttt{ff}, we cannot use R's regular save function. Instead, we'll have to use the \texttt{saveCohortMethodData()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{saveCohortMethodData}\NormalTok{(cmData, }\StringTok{"AceiVsThzForAngioedema"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can use the \texttt{loadCohortMethodData()} function to load the data in a future session.

\textbf{Defining new users}

Typically, a new user is defined as first time use of a drug (either target or comparator), and typically a washout period (a minimum number of days prior first use) is used to increase the probability that it is truly first use. When using the CohortMethod package, you can enforce the necessary requirements for new use in three ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  When defining the cohorts.
\item
  When loading the cohorts using the \texttt{getDbCohortMethodData} function, you can use the \texttt{firstExposureOnly}, \texttt{removeDuplicateSubjects}, \texttt{restrictToCommonPeriod}, and \texttt{washoutPeriod} arguments.
\item
  When defining the study population using the \texttt{createStudyPopulation} function (see below) using the \texttt{firstExposureOnly}, \texttt{removeDuplicateSubjects}, \texttt{restrictToCommonPeriod}, and \texttt{washoutPeriod} arguments.
\end{enumerate}

The advantage of option 1 is that the input cohorts are already fully defined outside of the CohortMethod package, and external cohort characterization tools can be used on the same cohorts used in this analysis. The advantage of options 2 and 3 is that they save you the trouble of limiting to first use yourself, for example allowing you to directly use the DRUG\_ERA table in the CDM. Option 2 is more efficient than 3, since only data for first use will be fetched, while option 3 is less efficient but allows you to compare the original cohorts to the study population.

\hypertarget{defining-the-study-population}{%
\subsection{Defining the study population}\label{defining-the-study-population}}

Typically, the exposure cohorts and outcome cohorts will be defined independently of each other. When we want to produce an effect size estimate, we need to further restrict these cohorts and put them together, for example by removing exposed subjects that had the outcome prior to exposure, and only keeping outcomes that fall within a defined risk window. For this we can use the \texttt{createStudyPopulation} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{studyPop <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createStudyPopulation}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{cohortMethodData =}\NormalTok{ cmData,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{outcomeId =} \DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{firstExposureOnly =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{restrictToCommonPeriod =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{washoutPeriod =} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{removeDuplicateSubjects =} \StringTok{"remove all"}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{removeSubjectsWithPriorOutcome =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{minDaysAtRisk =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{riskWindowStart =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{addExposureDaysToStart =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{riskWindowEnd =} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{,}
                                  \DataTypeTok{addExposureDaysToEnd =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we've set \texttt{firstExposureOnly} and \texttt{removeDuplicateSubjects} to FALSE, and \texttt{washoutPeriod} to 0 because we already applied those criteria in the cohort definitions. We specify the outcome ID we will use, and that people with outcomes prior to the risk window start date will be removed. The risk window is defined as starting on the day after the cohort start date (\texttt{riskWindowStart\ =\ 1} and \texttt{addExposureDaysToStart\ =\ FALSE}), and the risk windows ends when the cohort exposure ends (\texttt{riskWindowEnd\ =\ 0} and \texttt{addExposureDaysToEnd\ =\ TRUE}), which was defined as the end of exposure in the cohort definition. Note that the risk windows are automatically truncated at the end of observation or the study end date. We also remove subjects who have no time at risk. To see how many people are left in the study population we can always use the \texttt{getAttritionTable} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{getAttritionTable}\NormalTok{(studyPop)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\hypertarget{propensity-scores-1}{%
\subsection{Propensity scores}\label{propensity-scores-1}}

We can fit a propensity model using the covariates constructed by the \texttt{getDbcohortMethodData()} function, and compute a PS for each person:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ps <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createPs}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{cohortMethodData =}\NormalTok{ cmData, }\DataTypeTok{population =}\NormalTok{ studyPop)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{createPs} function uses the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/Cyclops/}{Cyclops} package to fit a large-scale regularized logistic regression. To fit the propensity model, Cyclops needs to know the hyperparameter value which specifies the variance of the prior. By default Cyclops will use cross-validation to estimate the optimal hyperparameter. However, be aware that this can take a really long time. You can use the \texttt{prior} and \texttt{control} parameters of the \texttt{createPs} function to specify Cyclops' behavior, including using multiple CPUs to speed-up the cross-validation.

Here we use the PS to perform variable-ratio matching:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{matchedPop <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{matchOnPs}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{population =}\NormalTok{ ps, }\DataTypeTok{caliper =} \FloatTok{0.2}\NormalTok{,}
                        \DataTypeTok{caliperScale =} \StringTok{"standardized logit"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{maxRatio =} \DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Alternatively, we could have used the PS in the \texttt{trimByPs}, \texttt{trimByPsToEquipoise}, or \texttt{stratifyByPs} functions.

\hypertarget{outcome-models}{%
\subsection{Outcome models}\label{outcome-models}}

The outcome model is a model describing which variables are associated with the outcome. Under strict assumptions, the coefficient for the treatment variable can be interpreted as the causal effect. In this case we fit a Cox proportional hazards model, conditioned (stratified) on the matched sets:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{outcomeModel <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{fitOutcomeModel}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{population =}\NormalTok{ matchedPop,}
                                \DataTypeTok{modelType =} \StringTok{"cox"}\NormalTok{,}
                                \DataTypeTok{stratified =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{outcomeModel}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Model type: cox

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{MultipleAnalyses}{%
\subsection{Running multiple analyses}\label{MultipleAnalyses}}

Often we want to perform more than one analyses, for example for multiple outcomes including negative controls. The \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortMethod/}{CohortMethod} offers functions for performing such studies efficiently. This is described in detail in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortMethod/articles/MultipleAnalyses.html}{package vignette on running multiple analyses}. Briefly, assuming the outcome of interest and negative control cohorts have already been created, we can specify all target-comparator-outcome combinations we wish to analyse:

Next, we specify what arguments should be used when calling the various functions described previously in our example with one outcome:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We then combine these into a single analysis settings object, which we provide a unique analysis ID and some description. We can combine one or more analysis settings objects into a list:

\NormalTok{cmAnalysisList <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{list}\NormalTok{(cmAnalysis)}

We can now run the study including all comparisons and analysis settings:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{result} object contains references to all the artifacts that were created. For example, we can retrieve the outcome model for AMI:

We can also retrieve the effect size estimates for all outcomes with one command:

\hypertarget{studyOutputs}{%
\section{Study outputs}\label{studyOutputs}}

Our estimates are only valid if several assumptions have been met. We use a wide set of diagnostics to evaluate whether this is the case. These are available in the results produced by the R package generated by ATLAS, or can be generated on the fly using specific R functions.

\hypertarget{propensity-scores-and-model}{%
\subsection{Propensity scores and model}\label{propensity-scores-and-model}}

We first need to evaluate whether the target and comparator cohort are to some extend comparable. For this we can compute the Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUC) statistic for the propensity model. An AUC of 1 indicates the treatment assignment was completely predictable based on baseline covariates, and that the two groups are therefore incomparable. We can use the \texttt{computePsAuc} function to compute the AUC, which in our example is 0.79. Using the \texttt{plotPs} function, we can also generate the preference score distribution as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ps}. Here we see that for many people the treatment they received was predictable, but there is also a large amount of overlap, indicating that adjustment can be used to select comparable groups. \index{preference score!example}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/ps} 

}

\caption{Preference score distribution.}\label{fig:ps}
\end{figure}

In general it is a good idea to also inspect the propensity model itself, and especially so if the model is very predictive. That way we may discover which variables are most predictive. Table \ref{tab:psModel} shows the top predictors in our propensity model. Note that if a variable is too predictive, the CohortMethod package will throw an informative error rather than attempt to fit a model that is already known to be perfectly predictive. \index{propensity model!example}

If a variable is found to be highly predictive, there are two possible conclusions: Either we find that the variable is clearly part of the exposure itself and should be removed before fitting the model, or else we must conclude that the two populations are truly incomparable, and the analysis must be stopped.

\hypertarget{covariate-balance}{%
\subsection{Covariate balance}\label{covariate-balance}}

The goal of using PS is to make the two groups comparable (or at least to select comparable groups). We must verify whether this is achieved, for example by checked whether the baseline covariates are indeed balanced after adjustment. We can use the \texttt{computeCovariateBalance} and \texttt{plotCovariateBalanceScatterPlot} functions to generate Figure \ref{fig:balance}. One rule-of-thumb to use is that no covariate may have an absolute standardized difference of means greater than 0.1 after propensity score adjustment. Here we see that although there was substantial imbalance before matching, after matching we meet this criterion. \index{covariate balance!example}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/balance}

\hypertarget{follow-up-and-power}{%
\subsection{Follow up and power}\label{follow-up-and-power}}

Before fitting an outcome model, we might be interested to know whether we have sufficient power to detect a particular effect size. It makes sense to perform these power calculations once the study population has been fully defined, so taking into account loss to the various inclusion and exclusion criteria (such as no prior outcomes), and loss due to matching and/or trimming. We can view the attrition of subjects in our study using the \texttt{drawAttritionDiagram} function as shown in Figure \ref{fig:attrition}. \index{attrition diagram}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/attrition} 

}

\caption{Attrition diagram. The counts shown at the top are those that meet our target and comparator cohort definitions. The counts at the bottom are those that enter our outcome model, in  this case a Cox regression.}\label{fig:attrition}
\end{figure}

Since the sample size is fixed in retrospective studies (the data has already been collected), and the true effect size is unknown, it is therefore less meaningful to compute the power given an expected effect size. Instead, the CohortMethod package provides the \texttt{computeMdrr} function to compute the minimum detectable relative risk (MDRR). In our example study the MDRR is 1.69. \index{minimum detectable relative risk (MDRR)} \index{power}

To gain a better understanding of the amount of follow-up available we can also inspect the distribution of follow-up time. We defined follow-up time as time at risk, so not censored by the occurrence of the outcome. The \texttt{getFollowUpDistribution} can provide a simple overview as shown in Figure \ref{fig:followUp}, which suggests the follow-up time for both cohorts is comparable.

One last check is to review the Kaplan-Meier plot, showing the survival over time in both cohorts. Using the \texttt{plotKaplanMeier} function we can create \ref{fig:kmPlot}, which we can check for example if our assumption of proportionality of hazards holds. The Kaplan-Meier plot automatically adjusts for stratification or weighting by PS. In this case, because variable-ratio matching is used, the survival curve for the comparator groups is adjusted to mimick what the curve had looked like for the target group had they been exposued to the comparator instead. \index{Kaplan-Meier plot} \index{survival plot|see {Kaplan-Meier plot}}

We observe a hazard ratio of 4.32 (95\% confidence interval: 2.45 - 8.08) for angioedema, which tells us that ACEi appear to increase the risk of angioedema compared to THZ. Similarly, we observe a hazard ratio of 1.13 (95\% confidence interval: 0.59 - 2.18) for AMI, suggesting little or no effect for AMI. Our diagnostics, as reviewed earlier, give no reason for doubt. However, ultimately the quality of this evidence, and whether we choose to trust it, depends on many factors that are not covererd by the study diagnostics as described in Chapter \ref{EvidenceQuality}.

\hypertarget{PatientLevelPrediction}{%
\chapter{Patient Level Prediction}\label{PatientLevelPrediction}}

\emph{Chapter leads: Peter Rijnbeek \& Jenna Reps}

Clinical decision making is a complicated task in which the clinician has to infer a diagnosis or treatment pathway based on the available medical history of the patient and the current clinical guidelines. Clinical prediction models have been developed to support this decision-making process and are used in clinical practice in a wide spectrum of specialties. These models predict a diagnostic or prognostic outcome based on a combination of patient characteristics, e.g.~demographic information, disease history, treatment history.

The number of publications describing clinical prediction models has increased strongly over the last 10 years. Most currently-used models are estimated using small datasets and consider only a small set of patient characteristics. This low sample size, and thus low statistical power, forces the data analyst to make strong modelling assumptions. The selection of the limited set of patient characteristics is strongly guided by the expert knowledge at hand. This contrasts sharply with the reality of modern medicine wherein patients generate a rich digital trail, which is well beyond the power of any medical practitioner to fully assimilate. Presently, health care is generating a huge amount of patient-specific information stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This includes structured data in the form of diagnose, medication, laboratory test results, and unstructured data contained in clinical narratives. It is unknown how much predictive accuracy can be gained by leveraging the large amount of data originating from the complete EHR of a patient.

Advances in machine learning for large dataset analysis have led to increased interest in applying patient-level prediction on this type of data. However, many published efforts in patient-level prediction do not follow the model development guidelines, fail to perform extensive external validation, or provide insufficient model details which limits the ability of independent researchers to reproduce the models and perform external validation. This makes it hard to fairly evaluate the predictive performance of the models and reduces the likelihood of the model being used appropriately in clinical practice. To improve standards, several papers have been written detailing guidelines for best practices in developing and reporting prediction models. For example, the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement \footnote{\url{https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/}} provides clear recommendations for reporting prediction model development and validation and addresses some of the concerns related to transparency.

Massive-scale, patient-specific predictive modeling has become reality due to OHDSI, where the common data model (CDM) allows for uniform and transparent analysis at an unprecedented scale. The databases available in the CDM contain rich data to build highly predictive large-scale models and also provide immediate opportunity to serve large communities of patients who are in most need of improved quality of care. Such models can inform truly personalized medical care leading hopefully to sharply improved patient outcomes.

In this chapter we describe OHDSI's standardized framework for patient-level prediction, \citep{reps2018} and discuss the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} R package that implements established best practices. We start with providing the necessary theory behind the development and evaluation of patient-level prediction and provide a high-level overview of the implemented machine learning algorithms. We then discuss an example prediction problem and provide step-by-step guidance on its definition and implementation using ATLAS or custom R code. Finally, we review two Shiny apps that allow viewing the study outputs. One app explores a single prediction model, while the other explores many models at once.

\hypertarget{the-prediction-problem}{%
\section{The prediction problem}\label{the-prediction-problem}}

Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, illustrates the prediction problem we address. Among a population at risk, we aim to predict which patients at a defined moment in time (t = 0) will experience some outcome during a time-at-risk. Prediction is done using only information about the patients in an observation window prior to that moment in time.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/Figure1} \caption{The prediction problem.}\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

As shown in Table \ref{tab:plpDesign}, to define a prediction problem we have to define t=0 by a target cohort, the outcome we like to predict by an outcome cohort, and the time-at-risk. We define the standard prediction question as:

\begin{quote}
Among \emph{{[}target cohort definition{]}}, who will go on to have \emph{{[}outcome cohort definition{]}} within \emph{{[}time-at-risk period{]}}?
\end{quote}

Furthermore, we have to make design choices for the model we like to develop, and determine the observational datasets to perform internal and external validation.

\hypertarget{data-extraction-2}{%
\section{Data extraction}\label{data-extraction-2}}

The observational data we use in OHDSI consist of time-stamped records of interactions of the patient with the healthcare system, as well as anonymized patient details such as gender and year of birth, stored in the CDM (Chapter \ref{CommonDataModel}). To use this information in a prediction problem, we must convert this data into two datasets:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A set of \textbf{covariates} (also referred to as ``features'' or ``independent variables''). These describe the characteristics of the patients. Covariates can include age, gender, presence of specific condition and exposure codes in a patient's record, etc.
\item
  A set describing the \textbf{outcome status} (also referred to as the ``labels'' or ``classes''). Did a patient experience the outcome of interest in the time-at-risk?
\end{enumerate}

When creating a predictive model we use a process know as supervised learning - a form of machine learning - to infer the relationship between the covariates and the outcome status. Once the model is created, we can apply it to patients where we know their characteristics (their covariates), but do not know their outcome status, to create a prediction.

Converting the data in the CDM to these two datasets requires selecting a set of people, and for these people selecting a specific date. We will refer to this date as the index date. Data prior to (and on) the index date is used to construct the covariates. Covariates are typically constructed using the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/FeatureExtraction/}{FeatureExtraction} package, described in more detail in Chapter \ref{Characterization}. Data after (or on) the index date is used to construct the outcome status. The group of people and their index date are defined by the \textbf{target cohort}. The outcome status is determined by the \textbf{time-at-risk}, which is usually defined relative to the target cohort start and end date, and the \textbf{outcome cohort}; If the outcome occurs within the time-at-risk, the outcome status is ``positive''.

\hypertarget{data-extraction-example}{%
\subsection{Data extraction example}\label{data-extraction-example}}

Table \ref{tab:plpExampleCohorts} shows an example COHORT table with two cohorts. The cohort with cohort definition ID 1 is the target cohort (e.g.~``people recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation''). Cohort definition ID 2 implies the outcome cohort (e.g.~``stroke'').

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\caption{\label{tab:plpExampleCohorts} Example COHORT table. For simplicity the cohort\_end\_date has been omitted.}\tabularnewline
\toprule

1 & 2 & 2001-06-01\tabularnewline
2 & 2 & 2001-07-01\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Table \ref{tab:plpExampleConditions} provides an example CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table. Concept ID \href{http://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/terms/320128}{320128} refers to ``Essential hypertension''.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\caption{\label{tab:plpExampleConditions} Example CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table. For simplicity only three columns are shown.}\tabularnewline
\toprule
person\_id & condition\_concept\_id & condition\_start\_date\tabularnewline

2 & 320128 & 2001-05-01\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Based on this example data, and assuming the time at risk is the year following the index date (the target cohort start date), we can construct the covariates and the outcome status. A covariate indicating ``Essential hypertension in the year prior'' will have the value 0 (not present) for person ID 1 (the condition occurred \emph{after} the index date), and the value 1 (present) for person ID 2. Similarly, the outcome status will be 0 for person ID 1 (this person had no entry in the outcome cohort), and 1 for person ID 2 (the outcome occurred within a year following the index date).

\hypertarget{missingness}{%
\subsection{Missingness}\label{missingness}}

Observational healthcare data rarely reflects whether data is missing. In the prior example, we simply observed the person with ID 1 had no essential hypertension occurrence prior to the index date. This could be because the condition was not present at that time, or because it was not recorded. There is no way to distinguish between the two. For machine learning this does not matter as much as one might think. If a covariate is predictive of the outcome status it will end up in the model, else not. However, we should be aware that our interpretation of covariates should be nuanced: it is not the actual condition that is the predictor, but rather the recording of the condition in the data.

\hypertarget{modelFitting}{%
\section{Fitting the model}\label{modelFitting}}

When fitting a model (using supervised learning) we are trying to establish the relationship between the covariates and the observed outcome status, so that if we do not yet know the outcome status, we can predict it. If we consider the situation where we have two covariates (for example systolic and diastolic blood pressure), then we can represent each patient as a plot in two dimensional space as shown in Figure \ref{fig:decisionBoundary}. The shape of a data points corresponds to the patient's outcome status (e.g.~stroke). The idea of supervised learning is to generalize what we see and fill in where there are no current data points. A supervised learning model will try to partition the space via a decision boundary that aims to minimize the cases where the outcome status does not match the models prediction. Different supervised learning techniques lead to different decision boundaries and there are often hyper-parameters that can impact the complexity of the decision boundary.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/decisionBoundary} 

}

\caption{Decision boundary.}\label{fig:decisionBoundary}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:decisionBoundary} we can see three different decision boundaries. The boundaries are used to infer the outcome status of any new data point. If a new data point falls into the shaded area then the model will predict ``has outcome'', otherwise it will predict ``no outcome''. Ideally a decision boundary should perfectly partition the two classes. However, generalizability is an issue, as complex models can ``overfit'' the data; boundaries may be fit too closely and may not work for new data. For example, if the data contains noise, with mislabelled or incorrectly positioned data points, we would not want to fit our model to that noise. We may pref to define a decision boundary that does not perfectly discriminate those with known outcome status, to get a model that better predicts for now, previously unseen patients. We want a model that appears to partition the labelled data well but is also as simple as possible. Techniques such as regularization aim to maximize model performance on the data with known outcome status while minimizing complexity. Complexity can also be controlled by picking classifier hyper-parameters such that a simpler decision boundary is used.

Another way to think about supervised learning is finding a function that maps from a patient's covariates to their label: \(p(outcome\ status = 1|covariates) = f(covariates)\). Each supervised learning algorithm has a different way to learn the mapping function and the no free lunch theorem states that no one algorithm is always going to outperform the others. The performance of each type of supervised learning algorithm depends on how the labelled data points are distributed in space. Therefore we recommend trying multiple supervised learning techniques with various hyper-parameter settings when developing patient-level prediction models.

The following algorithms are available in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} package:

\hypertarget{regularized-logistic-regression}{%
\subsection{Regularized logistic regression}\label{regularized-logistic-regression}}

LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression belongs to the family of generalized linear models, where a linear combination of the variables is learned and finally a logistic function maps the linear combination to a value between 0 and 1. The LASSO regularization adds a cost based on model complexity to the objective function when training the model. This cost is the sum of the absolute values of the linear combination of the coefficients. The model automatically performs feature selection by minimizing this cost. We use the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/Cyclops/}{Cyclops} (Cyclic coordinate descent for logistic, Poisson and survival analysis) package to perform large-scale regularized logistic regression.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Note that the variance is optimized by maximizing the out-of-sample likelihood in a cross-validation, so the starting variance has little impact on the performance of the resulting model. However, picking a starting variance that is too far from the optimal value may lead to long fitting time.

\hypertarget{gradient-boosting-machines}{%
\subsection{Gradient boosting machines}\label{gradient-boosting-machines}}

Gradient boosting machines is a boosting ensemble technique and in our framework it combines multiple decision trees. Boosting works by iteratively adding decision trees but adds more weight to the data-points that are misclassified by prior decision trees in the cost function when training the next tree. We use Extreme Gradient Boosting, which is an efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework implemented in the xgboost R package available from CRAN.

Random forest is a bagging ensemble technique that combines multiple decision trees. The idea behind bagging is to reduce the likelihood of overfitting, by using weak classifiers, but combining multiple diverse weak classifiers into a strong classifier. Random forest accomplishes this by training multiple decision trees but only using a subset of the variables in each tree and the subset of variables differ between trees. Our packages uses the sklearn implementation of Random Forest in Python.

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is an algorithm that uses some distance metric to find the K closest labelled data-points to a new unlabelled data-point. The prediction of the new data-points is then the most prevalent class of the K-nearest labelled data-points. There is a sharing limitation of KNN, as the model requires labelled data to perform the prediction on new data, and it is often not possible to share this data across data sites. We included the \href{https://github.com/OHDSI/BigKnn}{BigKnn} package developed in OHDSI which is a large scale KNN classifier.

The Naive Bayes algorithm applies the Bayes theorem with the naive assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable. Based on the likelihood the data belongs to a class and the prior distribution of the class, a posterior distribution is obtained. Naive Bayes has no hyper-parameters.

\hypertarget{adaboost}{%
\subsection{AdaBoost}\label{adaboost}}

AdaBoost is a boosting ensemble technique. Boosting works by iteratively adding classifiers but adds more weight to the data-points that are misclassified by prior classifiers in the cost function when training the next classifier. We use the sklearn AdaboostClassifier implementation in Python.

\hypertarget{decision-tree}{%
\subsection{Decision Tree}\label{decision-tree}}

A decision tree is a classifier that partitions the variable space using individual tests selected using a greedy approach. It aims to find partitions that have the highest information gain to separate the classes. The decision tree can easily overfit by enabling a large number of partitions (tree depth) and often needs some regularization (e.g., pruning or specifying hyper-parameters that limit the complexity of the model). We use the sklearn DecisionTreeClassifier implementation in Python.

Neural networks containing multiple layers of nodes that weight their inputs using a non-linear function. The first layer is the input layer, the last layer is the output layer, and in between are the hidden layers. Neural networks are generally trained using back-propagation, meaning the training input is propagated forward through the network to produce an output, the error between the output and the outcome status is computed, and this error is propagated backwards through the network to update the linear function weights.

Deep learning such as deep nets, convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks are similar to Multilayer Perceptrons but have multiple hidden layers that aim to learn latent representations useful for prediction. In a separate \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/articles/BuildingDeepLearningModels.html}{vignette} in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} package we describe these models and hyper-parameters in more detail.

\section{Evaluating prediction models}\label{evaluating-prediction-models}}

\hypertarget{evaluation-types}{%
\subsection{Evaluation Types}\label{evaluation-types}}

We can evaluate a prediction model by measuring the agreement between the model's prediction and observed outcome status, which means we need data where the outcome status is known.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
For evaluation we must use a different dataset than was used to develop the model, or else we run the risk of favoring models that are over-fitted (see Section \ref{modelFitting}) and may not perform well for new patients.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

We distinguish between

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Internal validation}: Using different sets of data extracted from the same database to develop and evaluate the model.
\item
  \textbf{External validation}: Developing the model in one database, and evaluating in another database.
\end{itemize}

There are two ways to perform internal validation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \textbf{holdout set} approach splits the labelled data into two independent sets: a train set and a test set (the hold out set). The train set is used to learn the model and the test set is used to evaluate it. We can simply divide our patients randomly into a train and test set, or we may choose to:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Split the data based on time (temporal validation), for example training on data before a specific date, and evaluating on data after that date. This may inform us on whether our model generalizes to different time periods.
  \item
    Split the data based on geographic location (spatial validation).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Cross validation} is useful when the data are limited. The data is split into \(n\) equally-sized sets, where \(n\) needs to be prespecified (e.g.~\(n=10\)). For each of these sets a model is trained on all data except the data in that set, and used to generate predictions for the held-out set. In this way, all data is used once to evaluate the model-building algorithm. In the patient-level prediction framework we use cross validation to pick the optimal hyper-parameters.
\end{itemize}

Note that some may consider bootstrapping to be another approach to internal validation, which is often used specifically to express the uncertainty around a model's prediction, typically as confidence intervals. We currently do not use bootstrapping in the patient-level prediction framework. TODO: maybe elaborate on this.

External validation is when a model trained in one database is validated on a data from another database. This is important as different databases may represent different patient populations, but also perhaps different healthcare systems and different data-capture processes. External validation can therefore inform us on how well a model will perform outside of the settings it was developed in.

\hypertarget{performance}{%
\subsection{Performance Metrics}\label{performance}}

\textbf{Threshold measures}

A prediction model assigns a value between 0 and 1 for each patient corresponding to the risk of the patient having the outcome during the time at risk. A value of 0 means 0\% risk, a value of 0.5 means 50\% risk and a value of 1 means 100\% risk. Common metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value can be calculated by first specifying a threshold that is used to classify patients as having the outcome or not during the time at risk. For example, given Table \ref{tab:tabletheorytab}, if we set the threshold as 0.5, the patients 1, 3, 7 and 10 have a predicted risk greater than or equal to the threshold of 0.5 so they would be predicted to have the outcome. All other patients had a predicted risk less than 0.5, so would be predicted to not have the outcome.

\end{longtable}

If a patient is predicted to have the outcome and has the outcome (during the time-at-risk) then this is called as a true positive (TP). If a patient is predicted to have the outcome but does not have the outcomethen this is called a false positive (FP). If a patient is predicted to not have the outcome and does not have the outcome then this is called a true negative (TN). Finally, if a patient is predicted to not have the outcome but does have the outcome then this is called a false negative (FN).

The following threshold based metrics are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  accuracy: \((TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)\)
\item
  sensitivity: \(TP/(TP+FN)\)
\item
  specificity: \(TN/(TN+FP)\)
\item
  positive predictive value: \(TP/(TP+FP)\)
\end{itemize}

Note that these values can either decrease or increase if the threshold is lowered. Lowering the threshold of a classifier may increase the denominator, by increasing the number of results returned. If the threshold was previously set too high, the new results may all be true positives, which will increase positive predictive value. If the previous threshold was about right or too low, further lowering the threshold will introduce false positives, decreasing positive predictive value. For sensitivity the denominator does not depend on the classifier threshold (\(TP+FN\) is a constant). This means that lowering the classifier threshold may increase sensitivity, by increasing the number of true positive results. It is also possible that lowering the threshold may leave sensitivity unchanged, while the positive predictive value fluctuates.

\textbf{Discrimination}

Discrimination is the ability to assign a higher risk to patients who will experience the outcome during the time at risk. The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) is determined by plotting 1 -- specificity on the x-axis and sensitivity on the y-axis at all possible thresholds. An example ROC plot is presented later in this chapter in Figure \ref{fig:shinyROC}. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) gives an overall measure of discrimination where a value of 0.5 corresponds to randomly assigning the risk and a value of 1 means perfect discrimination. In reality, most prediction models obtain AUCs between 0.6-0.8.

For rare outcomes even a model with a high AUC may not be practical, because for every positive above a given threshold there could also be many negatives (i.e.~the positive predictive value will be low). Depending on the severity of the outcome and cost (health risk and/or monetary) of some intervention, a high false positive rate may be impractical. When the outcome is rare another measure known as the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is therefore recommended. The AUPRC is the area under the line generated by plotting the sensitivity on the x-axis (also known as the recall) and the positive predictive value (also known as the precision) on the y-axis.

The AUC provides a way to determine how different the predicted risk distributions are between the patients who experience the outcome during the time at risk and those who do not. If the AUC is high, then the distributions will be mostly disjointed, whereas when there is a lot of overlap, the AUC will be closer to 0.5, see Figure \ref{fig:figuretheoryroctheory}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/theory/roctheory} \caption{How the ROC plots are linked to discrimination. If the two classes have similar distributions of prediced risk, the ROC will be close to the diagonal, with AUC close to 0.5.}\label{fig:figuretheoryroctheory}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Calibration}

Calibration is the ability of the model to assign the correct risk. For example, if the model assigned one hundred patients a risk of 10\% then ten of the patients should experience the outcome during the time at risk. If the model assigned 100 patients a risk of 80\% then eighty of the patients should experience the outcome during the time at risk. The calibration is generally calculated by partitioning the patients into deciles based on the predicted risk and in each group calculating the mean predicted risk and the fraction of the patients who experienced the outcome during the time at risk. We then plot these ten points (predicted risk on the y-axis and observed risk on the x-axis) and see whether they fall on the x = y line, indicating the model is well calibrated. An example calibration plot is presented later in this chapter in Figure \ref{fig:shinyCal}. We also fit a linear model using the points to calculate the intercept (which should be close to zero) and the gradient (which should be close to one). If the gradient is greater than one then the model is assigning a higher risk than the true risk and if the gradient is less than one the model is assigning a lower risk than the true risk.

\hypertarget{designing-a-patient-level-prediction-study}{%
\section{Designing a patient-level prediction Study}\label{designing-a-patient-level-prediction-study}}

In this section we will demonstrate how to design a prediction study. The first step is to clearly define the prediction problem. Interestingly, in many published papers the prediction problem is poorly defined, for example it is unclear how the index date (start of the target cohort) is defined. A poorly defined prediction problem does not allow for external validation by others let alone implementation in clinical practice. In the patient-level prediction framework we enforce proper specification of the prediction problem by requiring the key choices defined in Table \ref{tab:plpDesign} to be explicitly defined. Here we will walk through this process using a ``treatment safety'' type prediction problem as an example.

\hypertarget{problem-definition-2}{%
\subsection{Problem definition}\label{problem-definition-2}}

Angioedema is a well known side-effect of ACE inhibitors, and the incidence of angioedema reported in the labeling for ACE inhibitors is in the range of 0.1\% to 0.7\% \citep{byrd_2006}. Monitoring patients for this adverse effect is important, because although angioedema is rare, it may be life-threatening, leading to respiratory arrest and death \citep{norman_2013}. Further, if angioedema is not initially recognized, it may lead to extensive and expensive workups before it is identified as a cause \citep{norman_2013, thompson_1993}. Other than the higher risk among African-American patients, there are no known predisposing factors for the development of ACE inhibitor related angioedema \citep{byrd_2006}. Most reactions occur within the first week or month of initial therapy and often within hours of the initial dose \citep{circardi_2004}. However, some cases may occur years after therapy has begun \citep{mara_1996}. No diagnostic test is available that specifically identifies those at risk. If we could identify those at risk, doctors could act, for example by discontinuing the ACE inhibitor in favor of another hypertension drug.

We will apply the patient-level prediction framework to observational healthcare data to address the following patient-level prediction question:

\begin{quote}
Among patients who have just started on an ACE inhibitor for the first time, who will experience angioedema in the following year?
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{study-population-definition}{%
\subsection{Study population definition}\label{study-population-definition}}

The final study population in which we will develop our model is often a subset of the target cohort, because we may for example apply criteria that are dependent on the outcome, or we want to perform sensitivity analyses with sub-populations of the target cohort. For this we have to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{What is the minimum amount of observation time we require before the start of the target cohort?} This choice could depend on the available patient time in the training data, but also on the time we expect to be available in the data sources we want to apply the model on in the future. The longer the minimum observation time, the more baseline history time is available for each person to use for feature extraction, but the fewer patients will qualify for analysis. Moreover, there could be clinical reasons to choose a short or longer look-back period. For our example, we will use a 365-day prior history as look-back period (washout period).
\item
  \emph{Can patients enter the target cohort multiple times?} In the target cohort definition, a person may qualify for the cohort multiple times during different spans of time, for example if they had different episodes of a disease or separate periods of exposure to a medical product. The cohort definition does not necessarily apply a restriction to only let the patients enter once, but in the context of a particular patient-level prediction problem we may want to restrict the cohort to the first qualifying episode. In our example, a person can only enter the target cohort once since our criteria was based on first use of an ACE inhibitor.
\item
  \emph{Do we allow persons to enter the cohort if they experienced the outcome before?} Do we allow persons to enter the target cohort if they experienced the outcome before qualifying for the target cohort? Depending on the particular patient-level prediction problem, there may be a desire to predict incident first occurrence of an outcome, in which case patients who have previously experienced the outcome are not at risk for having a first occurrence and therefore should be excluded from the target cohort. In other circumstances, there may be a desire to predict prevalent episodes, whereby patients with prior outcomes can be included in the analysis and the prior outcome itself can be a predictor of future outcomes. For our prediction example, we will choose not to include those with prior angioedema.
\item
  \emph{How do we define the period in which we will predict our outcome relative to the target cohort start?} We have to make two decisions to answer this question. First, does the time-at-risk window start at the date of the start of the target cohort or later? Arguments to make it start later could be that we want to avoid outcomes that were entered late in the record that actually occurred before the start of the target cohort or we want to leave a gap where interventions to prevent the outcome could theoretically be implemented. Second, we need to define the time-at-risk by setting the risk window end, as some specification of days offset relative to the target cohort start or end dates. For our problem we will predict in a time-at-risk window starting 1 day after the start of the target cohort up to 365 days later.
\item
  \emph{Do we require a minimum amount of time-at-risk?} We have to decide if we want to include patients that did not experience the outcome but did leave the database earlier than the end of our time-at-risk period. These patients may experience the outcome when we no longer observe them. For our prediction problem we decide to answer this question with ``yes'', requiring a minimum time-at-risk for that reason. Furthermore, we have to decide if this constraint also applies to persons who experienced the outcome or we will include all persons with the outcome irrespective of their total time at risk. For example, if the outcome is death, then persons with the outcome are likely censored before the full time-at-risk period is complete.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{model-development-settings}{%
\subsection{Model development settings}\label{model-development-settings}}

To develop the prediction model we have to decide which algorithm(s) we like to train. We see the selection of the best algorithm for a certain prediction problem as an empirical question, i.e.~we prefer to let the data speak for itself and try different approaches to find the best one. There is no algorithm that will work best for all problems (no free lunch). In our framework we have therefore implemented many algorithms as described in Section \ref{modelFitting}, and allow others to be added. In this example, to keep things simple, we select just one algorithm: Gradient Boosting Machines.

Furthermore, we have to decide on the covariates that we will use to train our model. In our example, we like to add gender, age, all conditions, drugs and drug groups, and visit counts. We will look for these clinical events in the year before and any time prior the index date.

\hypertarget{model-evaluation}{%
\subsection{Model evaluation}\label{model-evaluation}}

Finally, we have to define how we will evaluate our model. For simplicity, we here choose internal validation. We have to decide how we divide our dataset in a training and test dataset and how we assign patients to these two sets. Here we will use a typical 75\% - 25\% split. Note that for very large datasets we could use more data for training.

\hypertarget{prediction-problem-settings}{%
\subsection{Prediction Problem Settings}\label{prediction-problem-settings}}

Here we select the target population cohorts and outcome cohorts for the analysis. A prediction model will be developed for all combinations of the target population cohorts and the outcome cohorts. For example, if we specify two target populations and two outcomes, we have specified four prediction problems.

To select a target population cohort we need to have previously defined it ATLAS. Instantiating cohorts is described in Chapter \ref{Cohorts}. The Appendix provides the full definitions of the target (Appendix \ref{AceInhibitors}) and outcome (Appendix \ref{Angioedema}) cohorts used in this example. To add a target population to the cohort, click on the ``Add Target Cohort'' button. Adding outcome cohorts similarly works by clicking the ``Add Outcome Cohort'' button. When done, the dialog should look like Figure \ref{fig:problemSettings}.

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Prediction problem settings.}\label{fig:problemSettings}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{analysis-settings}{%
\subsection{Analysis Settings}\label{analysis-settings}}

The analysis settings enables selection of the supervised learning algorithms, the covariates and population settings.

\textbf{Model Settings}

We can pick one or more supervised learning algorithms for model development. To add a supervised learning algorithms click on the ``Add Model Settings'' button. A dropdown containing all the models currently supported in the ATLAS interface will appear. We can select the supervised learning model we want to include in the study by clicking on the name in the dropdown menu. This will then show a view for that specific model, allowing the selection of the hyper-parameter values. If multiple values are provided, a grid search is performed across all possible combinations of values to select the optimal combination using cross-validation.

For our example we select gradient boosting machines, and set the hyper-parameters as specified in Figure \ref{fig:gbmSettings}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/gbmSettings} 

}

\caption{Gradient boosting machine settings}\label{fig:gbmSettings}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Covariate Settings}

We have defined a set of standard covariates that can be extracted from the observational data in the CDM format. In the covariate settings view, it is possible to select which of the standard covariates to include. We can define different types of covariate settings, and each model will be created separately with each specified covariate setting.

To add a covariate setting into the study, click on the ``Add Covariate Settings''. This will open the covariate setting view.

The first part of the covariate settings view is the exclude/include option. Covariates are generally constructed for any concept. However, we may want to include or exclude specific concepts, for example if a concept is linked to the target cohort definition. To only include certain concepts, create a concept set in ATLAS and then under the ``\textbf{What concepts do you want to include in baseline covariates in the patient-level prediction model? (Leave blank if you want to include everything)}'' select the concept set by clicking on \includegraphics{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/open.png}. We can automatically add all descendant concepts to the concepts in the concept set by answering ``yes'' to the question ``\textbf{Should descendant concepts be added to the list of included concepts?}'' The same process can be repeated for the question ``\textbf{What concepts do you want to exclude in baseline covariates in the patient-level prediction model? (Leave blank if you want to include everything)}'', allowing covariates corresponding to the selected concepts to be removed. The final option ``\textbf{A comma delimited list of covariate IDs that should be restricted to}'' enables us to add a set of covariate IDs (rather than concept IDs) comma separated that will only be included in the model. This option is for advanced users only. Once done, the inclusion and exclusion settings should look like Figure \ref{fig:covariateSettings1}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/covariateSettings1} 

}

\caption{Covariate inclusion and exclusion settings.}\label{fig:covariateSettings1}
\end{figure}

The next section enables the selection of non-time bound variables.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Gender: a binary variable indicating male or female gender
\item
  Age: a continuous variable corresponding to age in years
\item
  Age group: binary variables for every 5 years of age (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, \ldots, 95+)
\item
  Race: a binary variable for each race, 1 means the patient has that race recorded, 0 otherwise
\item
  Ethnicity: a binary variable for each ethnicity, 1 means the patient has that ethnicity recorded, 0 otherwise
\item
  Index year: a binary variable for each cohort start date year, 1 means that was the patients cohort start date year, 0 otherwise. \textbf{It often does not make sense to include index year, since we would like to apply our model to the future}.
\item
  Index month - a binary variable for each cohort start date month, 1 means that was the patients cohort start date month, 0 otherwise
\item
  Prior observation time: {[}Not recommended for prediction{]} a continuous variable corresponding to how long in days the patient was in the database prior to the cohort start date
\item
  Post observation time: {[}Not recommended for prediction{]} a continuous variable corresponding to how long in days the patient was in the database post cohort start date
\item
  Time in cohort: a continuous variable corresponding to how long in days the patient was in the cohort (cohort end date minus cohort start date)
\item
  Index year and month: {[}Not recommended for prediction{]} a binary variable for each cohort start date year and month combination, 1 means that was the patients cohort start date year and month, 0 otherwise
\end{itemize}

Once done, this section should look like Figure \ref{fig:covariateSettings2}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/covariateSettings2} 

}

\caption{Select covariates.}\label{fig:covariateSettings2}
\end{figure}

The standard covariates enable three flexible time intervals for the covariates:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  end days: when to end the time intervals relative to the cohort start date {[}default is 0{]}
\item
  long term {[}default -365 days to end days prior to cohort start date{]}
\item
  medium term {[}default -180 days to end days prior to cohort start date{]}
\item
  short term {[}default -30 days to end days prior to cohort start date{]}
\end{itemize}

Once done, this section should look like Figure \ref{fig:covariateSettings3}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/covariateSettings3} 

}

\caption{Time bound covariates.}\label{fig:covariateSettings3}
\end{figure}

The next option is the covariates extracted from the era tables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Condition: Construct covariates for each condition concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID with an era (i.e., the condition starts or ends during the time interval or starts before and ends after the time interval) during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the condition era table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Condition group: Construct covariates for each condition concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID \textbf{or any descendant concept ID} with an era during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the condition era table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Drug: Construct covariates for each drug concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID with an era during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the drug era table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Drug group: Construct covariates for each drug concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID \textbf{or any descendant concept ID} with an era during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the drug era table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\end{itemize}

Overlapping time interval setting means that the drug or condition era should start prior to the cohort start date and end after the cohort start date, so it overlaps with the cohort start date. The \textbf{era start} option restricts to finding condition or drug eras that start during the time interval selected.

Once done, this section should look like Figure \ref{fig:covariateSettings4}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/covariateSettings4} 

}

\caption{Time bound era covariates.}\label{fig:covariateSettings4}
\end{figure}

The next option selects covariates corresponding to concept IDs in each domain for the various time intervals:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Condition: Construct covariates for each condition concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID recorded during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the condition occurrence table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Condition Primary Inpatient: TODO
\item
  Drug: Construct covariates for each drug concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID recorded during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the drug exposure table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Procedure: Construct covariates for each procedure concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID recorded during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the procedure occurrence table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Measurement: Construct covariates for each measurement concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID recorded during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the measurement table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Measurement Value: Construct covariates for each measurement concept ID with a value and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID recorded during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the measurement table, the covariate value is the measurement value, otherwise 0.
\item
  Measurement range group: TODO
\item
  Observation: Construct covariates for each observation concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID recorded during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the observation table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Device: Construct covariates for each device concept ID and time interval selected and if a patient has the concept ID recorded during the specified time interval prior to the cohort start date in the device table, the covariate value is 1, otherwise 0.
\item
  Visit Count: Construct covariates for each visit and time interval selected and count the number of visits recorded during the time interval as the covariate value
\item
  Visit Concept Count: Construct covariates for each visit, domain and time interval selected and count the number of records per domain recorded during the visit type and time interval as the covariate value
\end{itemize}

The distinct count option counts the number of records per domain and time interval {[}TODO{]}.

Once done, this section should look like Figure \ref{fig:covariateSettings5}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/covariateSettings5} 

}

\caption{Time bound covariates.}\label{fig:covariateSettings5}
\end{figure}

The final option is whether to include commonly used risk scores as covariates. Once done, the risk score settings should look like Figure \ref{fig:covariateSettings6}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/covariateSettings6} 

}

\caption{Risk score covariate settings.}\label{fig:covariateSettings6}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Population Settings}

The population settings is where addition inclusion criteria can be applied to the target population and is also where the time-at-risk is defined. To add a population setting into the study, click on the ``Add Population Settings'' button. This will open up the population setting view.

The first set of options enable the user to specify the time-at-risk period. This is the time interval where we look to see whether the outcome of interest occurs. If a patient has the outcome during the time-at-risk period then we will classify them as ``Has outcome'', otherwise they are classified as ``No outcome''. ``\textbf{Define the time-at-risk window start, relative to target cohort entry:}'' defines the start of the time-at-risk, relative to the target cohort start or end date. Similarly, ``\textbf{Define the time-at-risk window end:}'' defines the end of the time-at-risk.

``\textbf{Minimum lookback period applied to target cohort}'' specifies the minimum baseline period; the minimum number of days prior to the cohort start date that a patient is continuously observed. The default is 365 days. Expanding the minimum look-back will give a more complete picture of a patient (as they must have been observed for longer) but will filter patients who do not have the minimum number of days prior observation.

If ``\textbf{Should subjects without time at risk be removed?}'' is set to yes, then a value for ``\textbf{Minimum time at risk:}'' is also required. This allows removing people who are lost to follow-up (i.e.~that have left the database during the time-at-risk period). For example, if the time-at-risk period was 1 day from cohort start until 365 days from cohort start, then the full time-at-risk interval is 364 days (365-1). If we only want to include patients who are observed the whole interval, then we set the minimum time at risk to be 364. If we are happy as long as people are in the time-at-risk for the first 100 days, then we select minimum time at risk to be 100. In this case as the time-at-risk start as 1 day from the cohort start, a patient will be include if they remain in the database for at least 101 days from the cohort start date. If we set ``Should subjects without time at risk be removed?'' to `No', then this will keep all patients, even those who drop out from the database during the time-at-risk.

The option ``\textbf{Include people with outcomes who are not observed for the whole at risk period?}'' is related to the previous option. If set to ``yes'', then people who experience the outcome during the time-at-risk are always kept, even if they are not observed for the specified minimum amount of time.

The option ``\textbf{Should only the first exposure per subject be included?}'' is only useful if our target cohort contains patients multiple times with different cohort start dates. In this situation, picking ``yes'' will result in only keeping the earliest target cohort date per patient in the analysis. Otherwise a patient can be in the dataset multiple times.

Setting ``\textbf{Remove patients who have observed the outcome prior to cohort entry?}'' to ``yes'' will remove patients who have the outcome prior to the time-at-risk start date, so the model is for patients who have never experience the outcome before. If ``no'' is selected, then patients could have had the outcome prior. Often, having the outcome prior is very predictive of having the outcome during the time-at-risk.

Once done, the population settings dialog should look like Figure \ref{fig:populationSettings}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/populationSettings} 

}

\caption{Population settings.}\label{fig:populationSettings}
\end{figure}

Now that we are finished with the Analysis Settings, the entire dialog should look like Figure \ref{fig:analysisSettings}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/analysisSettings} 

}

\caption{Analysis settings.}\label{fig:analysisSettings}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{execution-settings}{%
\subsection{Execution settings}\label{execution-settings}}

There are three options:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``\textbf{Perform sampling}'': here we choose whether to perform sampling (default = ``no''). If set to ``yes'', another option will appear: ``\textbf{How many patients to use for a subset?}'', where the sample size can be specified. Sampling can be an efficient means to determine if a model for a large population (e.g.~10 million patients) will be predictive, by creating and testing the model with a sample of patients. For example, if the AUC is close to 0.5 in the sample, we might abandon the model.
\item
  ``\textbf{Minimum covariate occurrence: If a covariate occurs in a fraction of the target population less than this value, it will be removed:}'': here we choose then minimum covariate occurrence (default = 0.001). A minimum threshold value for covariate occurrence is necessary to remove rare events that are not representative of the overall population.
\item
  ``\textbf{Normalize covariate}'': here we choose whether to normalize covariates (default = ``yes''). Normalization of the covariates is usually necessary for successful implementation of a LASSO model.
\end{itemize}

For our example we make the choices shown in Figure \ref{fig:executionSettings}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/executionSettings} 

}

\caption{Execution settings.}\label{fig:executionSettings}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{training-settings}{%
\subsection{Training settings}\label{training-settings}}

There are four options:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``\textbf{Specify how to split the test/train set:}'' Select whether to differentiate the train/test data by person (stratified by outcome) or by time (older data to train the model, later data to evaluate the model).
\item
  ``\textbf{Percentage of the data to be used as the test set (0-100\%)}'': Select the percentage of data to be used as test data (default = 25\%).
\item
  ``\textbf{The number of folds used in the cross validation}'': Select the number of folds for cross-validation used to select the optimal hyper-parameter (default = 3).
\item
  ``\textbf{The seed used to split the test/train set when using a person type testSplit (optional):}'': Select the random seed used to split the train/test set when using a person type test split.
\end{itemize}

For our example we make the choices shown in Figure \ref{fig:trainingSettings}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/trainingSettings} 

}

\caption{Training settings.}\label{fig:trainingSettings}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{importing-and-exporting-a-study}{%
\subsection{Importing and exporting a study}\label{importing-and-exporting-a-study}}

To export a study, click on the ``Export'' tab under ``Utilities''. ATLAS will produce JSON that can be directly copied and pasted into a file that contains all of the data, such as the study name, cohort definitions, models selected, covariates, settings, needed to run the study.

To import a study, click on the ``Import'' tab under ``Utilities''. Paste the contents of a patient-level prediction study JSON into this window, then click on the Import button below the other tab buttons. Note that this will overwrite all previous settings for that study, so this is typically done using a new, empty study design.

\hypertarget{downloading-the-study-package}{%
\subsection{Downloading the study package}\label{downloading-the-study-package}}

Click on the ``Review \& Download'' tab under ``Utilities''. In the ``Download Study Package'' section, enter a descriptive name for the R package, noting that any illegal characters in R will automatically be removed from the file name by ATLAS. Click on \includegraphics{images/PatientLevelPrediction/download.png} to download the R package to a local folder.

\hypertarget{running-the-study}{%
\subsection{Running the study}\label{running-the-study}}

To run the R package requires having R, RStudio, and Java installed as described in Section \ref{installR}. Also required is the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} package, which can be installed in R using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"drat"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{drat}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{addRepo}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"OHDSI"}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"PatientLevelPrediction"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Some of the machine learning algorithms require additional software to be installed. For a full description of how to install the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} package, see the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/articles/InstallationGuide.html}{``Patient-Level Prediction Installation Guide'' vignette}.

To use the study R package we recommend using R Studio. If you are running R Studio locally, unzip the file generated by ATLAS, and double click the .Rproj file to open it in R Studio. If you are running R Studio on an R studio server, click \includegraphics{images/PopulationLevelEstimation/upload.png} to upload and unzip the file, then click on the .Rproj file to open the project.

TODO: full instructions for running the package should be in the package README, not in the book.

After running the R package analysis we can view the results in an interactive shiny app by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{PatientLevelPrediction}\OperatorTok{::}\KeywordTok{viewMultiplePlp}\NormalTok{(outputFolder)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{implementing-the-study-in-r}{%
\section{Implementing the study in R}\label{implementing-the-study-in-r}}

An alternative to implementing our study design using ATLAS is to write the study code outselves in R. We can make use of the functions provided in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} package. The package enables data extraction, model building, and model evaluation using data from databases that are translated into the OMOP CDM.

\hypertarget{cohort-instantiation-2}{%
\subsection{Cohort instantiation}\label{cohort-instantiation-2}}

We first need to instantiate the target and outcome cohorts. Instantiating cohorts is described in Chapter \ref{Cohorts}. The Appendix provides the full definitions of the target (Appendix \ref{AceInhibitors}) and outcome (Appendix \ref{Angioedema}) cohorts. In this example we will assume the ACE inhibitors cohort has ID 1, and the angioedema cohort has ID 2.

\hypertarget{data-extraction-3}{%
\subsection{Data extraction}\label{data-extraction-3}}

We first need to tell R how to connect to the server. \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{\texttt{PatientLevelPrediction}} uses the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/}{\texttt{DatabaseConnector}} package, which provides a function called \texttt{createConnectionDetails}. Type \texttt{?createConnectionDetails} for the specific settings required for the various database management systems (DBMS). For example, one might connect to a PostgreSQL database using this code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(PatientLevelPrediction)}
\NormalTok{connDetails <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createConnectionDetails}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{dbms =} \StringTok{"postgresql"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{server =} \StringTok{"localhost/ohdsi"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{user =} \StringTok{"joe"}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{password =} \StringTok{"supersecret"}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{cdmDbSchema <-}\StringTok{ "my_cdm_data"}
\NormalTok{cohortsDbSchema <-}\StringTok{ "scratch"}
\NormalTok{cohortsDbTable <-}\StringTok{ "my_cohorts"}
\NormalTok{cdmVersion <-}\StringTok{ "5"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The last four lines define the \texttt{cdmDbSchema}, \texttt{cohortsDbSchema}, and \texttt{cohortsDbTable} variables, as well as the CDM version. We will use these later to tell R where the data in CDM format live, where the cohorts of interest have been created, and what version CDM is used. Note that for Microsoft SQL Server, database schemas need to specify both the database and the schema, so for example \texttt{cdmDbSchema\ \textless{}-\ "my\_cdm\_data.dbo"}.

First it makes sense to verify that the cohort creation has succeeded, by counting the number of cohort entries:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{paste}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"SELECT cohort_definition_id, COUNT(*) AS count"}\NormalTok{,}
\StringTok{"FROM @cohortsDbSchema.cohortsDbTable"}\NormalTok{,}
\StringTok{"GROUP BY cohort_definition_id"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{conn <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{connect}\NormalTok{(connDetails)}
\KeywordTok{renderTranslateQuerySql}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{connection =}\NormalTok{ conn, }
                        \DataTypeTok{sql =}\NormalTok{ sql,}
                        \DataTypeTok{cohortsDbSchema =}\NormalTok{ cohortsDbSchema,}
                        \DataTypeTok{cohortsDbTable =}\NormalTok{ cohortsDbTable)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##   cohort_definition_id  count
## 1                    1 527616
## 2                    2   3201
\end{verbatim}

Now we can tell \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} to extract all necessary data for our analysis. Covariates are extracted using the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/FeatureExtraction/}{\texttt{FeatureExtraction}} package. For more detailed information on the FeatureExtraction package see its vignettes. For our example study we decided to use these settings:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{covSettings <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{createCovariateSettings}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{useDemographicsGender =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{useDemographicsAge =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{useConditionGroupEraLongTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{useConditionGroupEraAnyTimePrior =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{useDrugGroupEraLongTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{useDrugGroupEraAnyTimePrior =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{useVisitConceptCountLongTerm =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{longTermStartDays =} \DecValTok{-365}\NormalTok{,}
                                       \DataTypeTok{endDays =} \DecValTok{-1}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The final step for extracting the data is to run the \texttt{getPlpData} function and input the connection details, the database schema where the cohorts are stored, the cohort definition IDs for the cohort and outcome, and the washout period which is the minimum number of days prior to cohort index date that the person must have been observed to be included into the data, and finally input the previously constructed covariate settings.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{plpData <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{getPlpData}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{connectionDetails =}\NormalTok{ connDetails,}
                      \DataTypeTok{cdmDatabaseSchema =}\NormalTok{ cdmDbSchema,}
                      \DataTypeTok{cohortDatabaseSchema =}\NormalTok{ cohortsDbSchema,}
                      \DataTypeTok{cohortTable =}\NormalTok{ cohortsDbSchema,}
                      \DataTypeTok{cohortId =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}
                      \DataTypeTok{covariateSettings =}\NormalTok{ covariateSettings,}
                      \DataTypeTok{outcomeDatabaseSchema =}\NormalTok{ cohortsDbSchema,}
                      \DataTypeTok{outcomeTable =}\NormalTok{ cohortsDbSchema,}
                      \DataTypeTok{outcomeIds =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}
                      \DataTypeTok{sampleSize =} \DecValTok{10000}
\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are many additional parameters for the \texttt{getPlpData} function which are all documented in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/PatientLevelPrediction/}{PatientLevelPrediction} manual. The resulting \texttt{plpData} object uses the package \texttt{ff} to store information in a way that ensures R does not run out of memory, even when the data are large.

Creating the \texttt{plpData} object can take considerable computing time, and it is probably a good idea to save it for future sessions. Because \texttt{plpData} uses \texttt{ff}, we cannot use R's regular save function. Instead, we'll have to use the \texttt{savePlpData} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{savePlpData}\NormalTok{(plpData, }\StringTok{"angio_in_ace_data"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can use the \texttt{loadPlpData()} function to load the data in a future session.

\hypertarget{additional-inclusion-criteria}{%
\subsection{Additional inclusion criteria}\label{additional-inclusion-criteria}}

The final study population is obtained by applying additional constraints on the two earlier defined cohorts, e.g., a minimum time at risk can be enforced (\texttt{requireTimeAtRisk,\ minTimeAtRisk}) and we can specify if this also applies to patients with the outcome (\texttt{includeAllOutcomes}). Here we also specify the start and end of the risk window relative to target cohort start. For example, if we like the risk window to start 30 days after the at-risk cohort start and end a year later we can set \texttt{riskWindowStart\ =\ 30} and \texttt{riskWindowEnd\ =\ 365}. In some cases the risk window needs to start at the cohort end date. This can be achieved by setting \texttt{addExposureToStart\ =\ TRUE} which adds the cohort (exposure) time to the start date.

In the example below all the settings we defined for our study are imposed:

\hypertarget{model-development}{%
\subsection{Model Development}\label{model-development}}

In the set function of an algorithm the user can specify a list of eligible values for each hyper-parameter. All possible combinations of the hyper-parameters are included in a so-called grid search using cross-validation on the training set. If a user does not specify any value then the default value is used instead.

For example, if we use the following settings for the gradient boosting machine: \texttt{ntrees\ =\ c(100,200),\ maxDepth\ =\ 4} the grid search will apply the gradient boosting machine algorithm with \texttt{ntrees\ =\ 100} and \texttt{maxDepth\ =\ 4} plus the default settings for other hyper-parameters and \texttt{ntrees\ =\ 200} and \texttt{maxDepth\ =\ 4} plus the default settings for other hyper-parameters. The hyper-parameters that lead to the best cross-validation performance will then be chosen for the final model. For our problem we choose to build a gradient boosting machine with several hyper-parameter values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gbmModel <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{setGradientBoostingMachine}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{ntrees =} \DecValTok{5000}\NormalTok{, }
                                       \DataTypeTok{maxDepth =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{), }
                                       \DataTypeTok{learnRate =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\FloatTok{0.001}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{0.01}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{0.1}\NormalTok{,}\FloatTok{0.9}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{runPlP} function uses the population, \texttt{plpData}, and model settings to train and evaluate the model. We can use the \texttt{testSplit} (person/time) and \texttt{testFraction} parameters to split the data in a 75\%-25\% split and run the patient-level prediction pipeline:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gbmResults <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{runPlp}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{population =}\NormalTok{ population, }
                     \DataTypeTok{plpData =}\NormalTok{ plpData, }
                     \DataTypeTok{modelSettings =}\NormalTok{ gbmModel, }
                     \DataTypeTok{testSplit =} \StringTok{'person'}\NormalTok{,}
                     \DataTypeTok{testFraction =} \FloatTok{0.25}\NormalTok{, }
                     \DataTypeTok{nfold =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }
                     \DataTypeTok{splitSeed =} \DecValTok{1234}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Under the hood the package will now use the R xgboost package to fit a a gradient boosting machine model using 75\% of the data and will evaluate the model on the remaining 25\%. A results data structure is returned containing information about the model, its performance etc.

In the \texttt{runPlp} function there are several parameters to save the \texttt{plpData}, \texttt{plpResults}, \texttt{plpPlots}, \texttt{evaluation}, etc. objects which are all set to \texttt{TRUE} by default.

We can save the model using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{savePlpModel}\NormalTok{(gbmResults}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{model, }\DataTypeTok{dirPath =} \StringTok{"model"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can load the model using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{plpModel <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{loadPlpModel}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"model"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can also save the full results structure using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{savePlpResult}\NormalTok{(gbmResults, }\DataTypeTok{location =} \StringTok{"gbmResults"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To load the full results structure use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{gbmResults <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{loadPlpResult}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"gbmResults"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{internal-validation}{%
\subsection{Internal Validation}\label{internal-validation}}

Once we execute the study, the \texttt{runPlp} function returns the trained model and the evaluation of the model on the train/test sets. You can interactively view the results by running: \texttt{viewPlp(runPlp\ =\ gbmResults)}. This will open a Shiny App in which we can view all performance measures created by the framework, including interactive plots, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:shinySummary}.

To generate and save all the evaluation plots to a folder run the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{plotPlp}\NormalTok{(gbmResults, }\StringTok{"plots"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The plots are described in more detail in Section \ref{performance}.

\hypertarget{external-validation}{%
\subsubsection{External validation}\label{external-validation}}

We recommend to always perform external validation, i.e.~apply the final model on as much new datasets as feasible and evaluate its performance. Here we assume the data extraction has already been performed on a second database and stored in the \texttt{newData} folder. We load the model we previously fitted from the \texttt{model} folder:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# load the trained model}
\NormalTok{plpModel <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{loadPlpModel}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"model"}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{#load the new plpData and create the population}
\NormalTok{plpData <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{loadPlpData}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"newData"}\NormalTok{)}

                                    \DataTypeTok{washoutPeriod =} \DecValTok{364}\NormalTok{,}
                                    \DataTypeTok{firstExposureOnly =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{,}

\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{# apply the trained model on the new data}
\NormalTok{validationResults <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{applyModel}\NormalTok{(population, plpData, plpModel)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To make things easier we also provide the \texttt{externalValidatePlp} function for performing external validation that also extracts the required data. Assuming we ran \texttt{result\ \textless{}-\ runPlp(...)} then we can extract the data required for the model and evaluated it on new data. Assuming the validation cohorts are in the table \texttt{mainschema.dob.cohort} with IDs 1 and 2 and the CDM data is in the schema \texttt{cdmschema.dob}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{valResult <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{externalValidatePlp}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{plpResult =}\NormalTok{ result, }
                                 \DataTypeTok{connectionDetails =}\NormalTok{ connectionDetails,}
                                 \DataTypeTok{validationSchemaTarget =} \StringTok{'mainschema.dob'}\NormalTok{,}
                                 \DataTypeTok{validationSchemaOutcome =} \StringTok{'mainschema.dob'}\NormalTok{,}
                                 \DataTypeTok{validationSchemaCdm =} \StringTok{'cdmschema.dbo'}\NormalTok{,}
                                 \DataTypeTok{databaseNames =} \StringTok{'new database'}\NormalTok{,}

                                 \DataTypeTok{validationIdOutcome =} \DecValTok{2}
\NormalTok{          )}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we have multiple databases to validate the model on then we can run:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{valResults <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{externalValidatePlp}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{plpResult =}\NormalTok{ result, }

\hypertarget{single-model-viewer-app}{%
\section{Single model viewer app}\label{single-model-viewer-app}}

Exploring the performance of a prediction model is easiest with the \texttt{viewPlp} function. This requires a results object as the input. If developing models in R we can use the result of \texttt{runPLp} as the input. If using the ATLAS-generated study package, then we need to load one of the models (in this example we will load Analysis\_1):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{plpResult <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{loadPlpResult}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{file.path}\NormalTok{(outputFolder, }
                                     \StringTok{'Analysis_1'}\NormalTok{, }
                                     \StringTok{'plpResult'}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Here ``Analysis\_1'' corresponds to the analysis we specified earlier.

We can then launch the shiny app by running:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{viewPlp}\NormalTok{(plpResult)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The Shiny app opens with a summary of the performance metrics on the test and train sets, see Figure \ref{fig:shinySummary}. The results show that the AUC on the train set was 0.78 and this dropped to 0.74 on the test set. The test set AUC is the more accurate measure. Overall, the model appears to be able to discriminate those who will develop the outcome in new users of ACE inhibitors but it slightly overfit as the performance on the train set is higher than the test set. The ROC plot is presented in Figure \ref{fig:shinyROC}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/shinysummary} \caption{Summary evaluation statistics in the Shiny app.}\label{fig:shinySummary}

\caption{The ROC plot.}\label{fig:shinyROC}
\end{figure}

The calibration plot in Figure \ref{fig:shinyCal} shows that generally the observed risk matches the predicted risk as the dots are around the diagonal line. The demographic calibration plot in Figure \ref{fig:shinyDemo} however shows that the model is not well calibrated for the younger patients, as the blue line (the predicted risk) differs from the red line (the observed risk) for those aged below 40. This may indicate we need to remove the under 40s from the target population (as the observed risk for the younger patients is nearly zero).

\end{figure}

Finally, the attrition plot shows the loss of patients from the labelled data based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, see Figure \ref{fig:shinyAtt}. The plot shows that we lost a large portion of the target population due to them not being observed for the whole time at risk (1 year follow up). Interestingly, not as many patients with the outcome lacked the complete time at risk.

\hypertarget{multiple-model-viewer-app}{%
\section{Multiple model viewer app}\label{multiple-model-viewer-app}}

The study package as generated by ATLAS allows generating and evaluating many different prediction models, for different prediction problems. Therefore, specifically for the output generated by the study package an additional Shiny app has been developed for viewing multiple models. To start this app, run \texttt{viewMultiplePlp(outputFolder)} where \texttt{outputFolder} is the path containing the analysis results as specified when running the \texttt{execute} command (and should for example contain a sub-folder named ``Analysis\_1'').

\hypertarget{viewing-the-model-summary-and-settings}{%
\subsection{Viewing the model summary and settings}\label{viewing-the-model-summary-and-settings}}

The interactive shiny app will start at the summary page as shown in Figure \ref{fig:multiShinySummary}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/shiny/shinyFilter} 

}

\caption{The shiny summary page containing key hold out set performance metrics for each model trained}\label{fig:multiShinySummary}
\end{figure}

This summary page table contains:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  basic information about the model (e.g., database information, classifier type, time at risk settings, target population and outcome names)
\item
  hold out target population count and incidence of outcome
\item
  discrimination metrics: AUC, AUPRC
\end{itemize}

To the left of the table is the filter option, where we can specify the development/validation databases to focus on, the type of model, the time at risk settings of interest and/or the cohorts of interest. For example, to pick the models corresponding to the target population ``New users of ACE inhibitors as first line monotherapy for hypertension'', select this in the \emph{Target Cohort} option.

To explore a model click on the corresponding row, a selected row will be highlighted. With a row selected, we can now explore the model settings used when developing the model by clicking on the \emph{Model Settings} tab:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/shiny/shinyModel} 

}

\caption{To view the model settings used when developing the model.}\label{fig:shinyModel}
\end{figure}

Similarly, we can explore the population and covariate settings used to generate the model in the other tabs.

\hypertarget{viewing-model-performance}{%
\subsection{Viewing model performance}\label{viewing-model-performance}}

Once a model row had been selected we can also view the model performance. Click on \includegraphics{images/PatientLevelPrediction/performance.png} to open the threshold performance summary shown in Figure \ref{fig:shinyPerformanceSum}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/shiny/shinyPerformanceSum} 

}

\caption{The summary performance measures at a set threshold.}\label{fig:shinyPerformanceSum}
\end{figure}

This summary view shows the selected prediction question in the standard format, a threshold selector and a dashboard containing key threshold based metrics such as positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity (see Section \ref{performance}). In Figure \ref{fig:shinyPerformanceSum} we see that at a threshold of 0.00482 the sensitivity is 83.4\% (83.4\% of patients with the outcome in the following year have a risk greater than or equal to 0.00482) and the PPV is 1.2\% (1.2\% of patients with a risk greater than or equal to 0.00482 have the outcome in the following year). As the incidence of the outcome within the year is 0.741\%, identifying patients with a risk greater than or equal to 0.00482 would find a subgroup of patients that have nearly double the risk of the population average risk. We can adjust the threshold using the slider to view the performance at other values.

To look at the overall discrimination of the model click on the ``Discrimination'' tab to view the ROC plot, precision-recall plot, and distribution plots. The line on the plots corresponds to the selected threshold point. Figure \ref{fig:shinyPerformanceDisc} show the ROC and precision-recall plots. The ROC plot shows the model was able to discriminate between those who will have the outcome within the year and those who will not. However, the performance looks less impressive when we see the precision-recall plot, as the low incidence of the outcome means there is a high false positive rate.

Figure \ref{fig:shinyPerformanceDist} shows the prediction and preference score distributions.

\caption{The predicted risk distribtion for those with and without the outcome. The more these overlap the worse the discrimination}\label{fig:shinyPerformanceDist}

Finally, we can also inspect the calibration of the model by clicking on the ``Calibration'' tab. This displays the calibration plot and the demographic calibration shown in Figure \ref{fig:shinyPerformanceCal}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/PatientLevelPrediction/shiny/shinyPerformanceCal} 

}

\caption{The risk stratified calibration and demographic calibration}\label{fig:shinyPerformanceCal}
\end{figure}

We see that the average predicted risk appears to match the observed fraction who experienced the outcome within a year, so the model is well calibrated. Interestingly, the demographic calibration shows that the blue line is higher than the red line for young patients, so we are predicting a higher risk for young age groups. Conversely, for the patients above 80 the model is predicting a lower risk than the observed risk. This may prompt us to develop separate models for the younger or older patients.

To inspect the final model, select the \includegraphics{images/PatientLevelPrediction/modelButton.png} option from the left hand menu. This will open a view containing plots for each variable in the model, shown in Figure \ref{fig:shinyModelPlots}, and a table summarizing all the candidate covariates, shown in Figure \ref{fig:shinyModelTable}. The variable plots are separated into binary variables and continuous variables. The x-axis is the prevalence/mean in patients without the outcome and the y-axis is the prevalence/mean in patients with the outcome. Therefore, any variable's dot falling above the diagonal is more common in patients with the outcome and any variable's dot falling below the diagonal is less common in patients with the outcome.

The table in Figure \ref{fig:shinyModelTable} displays the name, value (coefficient if using a general linear model, or variable importance otherwise) for all the candidate covariates, outcome mean (the mean value for those who have the outcome) and non-outcome mean (the mean value for those who do not have the outcome).

\section{Understanding Evidence Quality}\label{understanding-evidence-quality}}

How do we know if the results of a study are reliable? Can they be trusted for use in clinical settings? What about in regulatory decision-making? Can they serve as a foundation for future research? Each time a new study is published or disseminated, readers must consider these questions, regardless of whether the work was a randomized controlled trial, an observational study, or other type of analysis.

One of the concerns that is often raised around observational studies and the use of ``real world data'' is the topic of data quality \citep{botsis2010secondary, hersh2013caveats, sherman2016real}. Commonly noted is that data used in observational research were not originally gathered for research purposes and thus may suffer from incomplete or inaccurate data capture as well inherent biases. These concerns have given rise to a growing body of research around how to measure, characterize, and ideally improve data quality \citep{kahn2012pragmatic, liaw2013towards, weiskopf2013methods}. The OHDSI community is a strong advocate of such research and community members have led and participated in many studies looking at data quality in the OMOP CDM and the OHDSI network \citep{huser_multisite_2016, kahn_transparent_2015, callahan2017comparison, yoon_2016}.

Given the findings of the past decade in this area, it has become apparent that data quality is not perfect and never will be. This notion is nicely reflected in this quote from Dr Clem McDonald, a pioneer in the field of medical informatics:

\begin{quote}
Loss of fidelity begins with the movement of data from the doctor's brain to the medical record.
\end{quote}

Thus, as a community we must ask the question-- \emph{given imperfect data, how can we achieve the most reliable evidence?} The OHDSI community is seeking to address this question through a holistic focus on ``evidence quality''. Evidence quality considers not only the quality of observational data but also the validity of the methods, software, and clinical definitions used in our observational analyses.

In the following chapters, we will explore four components of evidence quality:

\section{Communicating Evidence Quality}\label{communicating-evidence-quality}}

An important aspect of evidence quality is the ability to express the uncertainty that comes from the data being imperfect. Thus, our efforts around evidence quality include not only concepts but also specific tools and community processes. The overarching goal of OHDSI's work around evidence quality is to produce confidence in health care decision-makers that the evidence generated by OHDSI-- while undoubtedly imperfect in many ways-- has been consistently measured for its weaknesses and strengths and that this information has been communicated in a rigorous and open manner.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

Kahn et al.~define data quality as consisting of three components: (1) conformance (do data values adhere to do specified standard and formats?; subtypes: value, relational and computational conformance); (2) completeness (are data values present?); and (3) plausibility (are data values believable?; subtypes uniqueness, atemporal; temporal) \citep{kahn_harmonized_2016}

Kahn additionaly defines two contexts: verification and validation. Verification focuses on model and data constraints and does not rely on external reference. Validation focuses on data expectations that are derived from comparison to a relative gold standard and uses external knowledge.

Table below shows examples of the above defined data quality (DQ) constructs.

Kahn introduces the term \emph{data quality check} (sometimes refered to as data quality rule) that tests whether data conform to a given requirement (e.g., implausible age of 141 of a patient (due to incorrect birth year or missing death event)). In support of checks, he also defines \emph{data quality measure} (sometimes refered to as pre-computed analysis) as data analysis that supports evaluation of a check. For example, distribution of days of supply by drug concept.

Two types of DQ checks can be distinguished\citep{weiskopf_methods_2013}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  general checks
\item
  study-specific checks
\end{itemize}

From the point of researcher analyzing the data, the desired situation is that data is free from erros that could have been prevented. \emph{ETL data errors} are errors introduced during extract-tranform-load proces. A special type of ETL data error is \emph{mapping error} that results from incorrect mapping of the data from the source terminology (e.g., Korean national drug terminology) into the target data model's standard terminology (e.g., RxNorm and RxNorm Extension). A \emph{source data error} is an error that is already present in the source data due to various cuases (e.g., human typo during data entry).\citep{huser_multisite_2016}

Data quality can also be seen as a component in a larger effort refered to as \emph{evidence quality} or \emph{evidence validation}. Data quality would fall in this framework under \emph{data validation}.

\hypertarget{achilles-heel-tool}{%

\hypertarget{precomputed-analyses}{%
\subsection{Precomputed Analyses}\label{precomputed-analyses}}

In support of data characterization, Achilles tool pre-computes number of data analyses. Each pre-computed analysis has an analysis ID and a short description of the analysis. For example, ``715: Distribution of days\_supply by drug\_concept\_id'' or ``506: Distribution of age at death by gender''. List of all pre-computed analyses (for Achilles version 1.6.3) as available at \url{https://github.com/OHDSI/Achilles/blob/v1.6.3/inst/csv/achilles/achilles_analysis_details.csv}

Achilles has more than 170 pre-computed analysis that support not only data quality checks but also general data characterization (outside data quality context) such as data density visualizations. The pre-computations are largely guided by the CDM relational database schema and analyze most terminology-based data columns, such as condition\_concept\_id or place\_of\_service\_concept\_id. Pre-computations results are stored in table ACHILLES\_RESULTS and ACHILLES\_RESULTS\_DIST.

In complete data about general population, a range of services is provided by a range of providers (with many specialties). A data completness rule with rule\_id of 38 evaluates data completness in the PROVIDER table. Checking optional fields in CDM (such as provider specialty) lead to a notification severity output. Analysis Rule 38 triggers a notification if count of distinct specialties \textless2. It relies on a derived measure \texttt{Provider:SpeciatlyCnt}.

Checks are classified into CDM conformance checks and DQ checks.

Depending on the severity of the problem, the Heel output can be error, warning or notification.

The goal of the Research Network is to lower the barrier to performing large-scale collaborative research using observational data to generate high-quality evidence through peer review across study design, execution, and data analysis \citep{Hripcsak2015}. Patient care and policy decisions demand high-quality evidence. Some have hypothesized that the volume, velocity, and veracity of observational data from electronic health records, administrative claims, and investment in data networks can be positioned to meet this demand. Analyses in large data sets are not necessarily correct simply because they are larger. Deficient studies may lead to misuse of resources and result in poor health care oucomes for patients (Morton et al). This chapter will focus on the question: `To what extent does the analysis conducted match the clinical intention?'

Studies using observational data usually begin by developing cohorts of subjects to compare for determining some effect estimate. During the development of these cohorts certain assumptions are made concerning the validity of the created cohorts, the most important of which is that the subjects in the cohorts have the characteristic that is the basis of the study. For example, if the study involves subjects with myocardial infarction (MI) each of the subjects in the cohort must have had an MI. Ideally, we would definitive evidence of the diagnosis of MI. However, with observational data, we use subject records derived from limited data collected for a specific purpose. In some cases, the data may be derived from data sets specifically collected from subjects with the health condition of interest such as disease registries. While this is high quality data, it is usually a subset of all the subject's data. For example, the data for subjects with MI may include the interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and not the actual data from the ECG. Subjects are included in these registries based on a clinical review of each subject's health record. In other cases, the data is derived from administrative datasets from insurance claims. These data are usually much more limited than data from health registries but have the advantage of usually including a larger number of subjects from a broader population which may be more generalizable to the overall population. In the case of administrative data, determination of the health claim for a subject is based on administrative codes for the health condition. In the US, for example, these codes are from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Regardless of the origin of the data, the validity of the health conditions based on this data need to be validated.
An example of a typical epidemiological study is shown in the diagram below:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ClinicalValidity/figure1} \end{center}

In this example, we are comparing the rates of the occurrence of MI in one year in cohorts of subjects who initiated either Drug A or Drug B. In this example, it is critical for the validity of the study to have valid measures of the rate of MI occurrence. For studies where administrative data is used, the determination of MI is typically from the use of a phenotype algorithm (PA). A PA is a heuristic-based set of rules used to determine the health condition with good precision. These algorithms are often derived from prior research some of which may have been validated. Examples of typical PAs for MI are illustrated below:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  One or more occurrences of MI in the subject's record
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ClinicalValidity/figure2} \end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  One occurrence of MI in the subject's record followed by a second occurrence within 30 days
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ClinicalValidity/figure3} \end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  One or more occurrences of MI in the subject's record from a hospital in-patient setting
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ClinicalValidity/figure4} \end{center}

Once the PA for the study has been determined, the validity of the definition needs to be determined. To determine the validity of the different algorithms, we need to examine several performance characteristics of the PA including:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Sensitivity of the PA -- what proportion of the subjects with the health condition in the whole cohort were determined to have the health outcome based on the PA?
\item
  Specificity of the PA - what proportion of the subjects without the health condition in the whole cohort were determined to not have the health outcome based on the PA?
\item
  Positive predictive value of the PA - what proportion of the subjects determined by the PA to have the health condition actually had the health condition?
\item
  Negative predictive value of the PA - what proportion of the subjects determined by the PA to not have the health condition actually did not have the health condition?
\end{enumerate}

The methods used to determine these performance characteristics are described in the remainder of this section.
Validation Methods for Phenotype Algorithms
The traditional method that has been used to validate PAs has been through a thorough examination of subject records by one or more people with sufficient clinical knowledge to accurately determine the health condition of interest. The method generally follows these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Select a random subset of subjects from the overall cohort.
\item
  Obtain permission from these subjects to receive health records.
\item
  Obtain the health records from those subjects who have granted permission to do so from their physicians.
\item
  Select one or more persons with sufficient clinical expertise to review subject records.
\item
  Determine the guidelines for adjudicating whether a subject is positive or negative for the health condition.
\item
  Use the results from the clinical adjudication to calculate the performance characteristics of the PA used in the study.
\end{enumerate}

Each step in the above process has the potential to bias the results of the study. For example, obtaining permission from subjects may be difficult and may introduce selection bias if those subjects who provide permission differ from those who do not. In addition, obtaining the patient records and conducting a clinical review of those records is a time consuming and costly process. In order to complete this process, many studies only examine the records of those subjects the PA identified as cases for the health conditions. Under those conditions, the only performance characteristic that can be calculated is positive predictive value.
In the OHDSI community, we were in the process of developing a different approach. We are attempting to use diagnostic predictive models as an alternative method for cohort validation. The general idea is to simulate the ascertainment of the health outcome similar to the way clinicians would in a traditional phenotype algorithm validation but at scale. In this process we develop a diagnostic predictive model for a health outcome and then use that model to determine the probability of a health outcome in a large set of subjects, the ``evaluation'' cohort, within the data set. We then use that evaluation cohort to test our phenotype algorithms. Using this method, we are able to determine the full set of performance characteristics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value) at scale. The tool is being developed as an open-source R package called \href{https://github.com/OHDSI/PheValuator}{\textbf{PheValuator}}.

The process is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Develop a diagnostic predictive model for a phenotype: Diagnostic predictive models are used to estimate the probability that a specific outcome or disease is present in an individual.\citep{moons_transparent_2015} The output of the model is a set of weighted predictors for diagnosing a phenotype.
\item
  Determine the probability of a phenotype for each individual in a large group of subjects: The set of predictors from the model can be used to estimate the probability of the presence of a phenotype in an individual. We use these predictions as a `probabilistic gold standard'.
\item
  Evaluate the performance characteristics of the PAs: We compare the predicted probability to the binary classification of a PA (the test conditions for the confusion matrix). Using the test conditions and the estimates for the true conditions, we can fully populate the confusion matrix and determine the full set of performance characteristics, i.e., sensitivity, specific, and predictive values.
  There are limitations using this approach. First, we can only use data that is in dataset; we are limited to diagnoses, procedures, observations, measurements, and drug exposures. Moreover, measurements are usually incomplete in administrative datasets as these do not include the actual values for the measures and, as such, we are limited to the existence or absence of the measurements as part of the model. Clinical notes are also not usually present in our data sets. Patient complaints or symptoms may not be recorded in administrative data sets. These may include things like lethargy and acute pain.
  In diagnostic predictive modeling we create a model that discriminates between those with the disease and those without the disease. For the PheValuator process, we use an extremely specific cohort definition, the ``xSpec'' cohort, to determine the cases for the models. The xSpec cohort uses a definition to find those with the disease with a very high probability of having the disease of interest. The xSpec cohort is may be defined as those subjects who have multiple condition code codes in their record for the health outcome of interest. For example, for atrial fibrillation, we may have subjects who have 10 or more codes for atrial fibrillation in their record. For MI, an acute outcome, we may use 5 occurrences of MI and include the requirement of having at least two occurrences from a hospital inpatient setting. For our non-cases, we exclude anybody from the data set who have any of the condition occurrences for the health outcome of interest. There are limitations to this method. It is possible that these xSpec cohort subjects may have may be more severe than other cases of the disease. It may also be that these subjects had longer observation time after initial diagnosis than the average patient. We use logistic regression to create these models, using the LASSO method.\citep{tibshirani_regression_1996} This method produces a parsimonious model. In so doing it removes many of the collinear covariates which may be present in many subjects. In the current version of our software we also do not include the temporality of events in the patient's record.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Practice of Phenotype Algorithm Validation}

An example of the process to conduct a PA validation using chart review is provided by Cutrona and colleagues who validated their PA for MI for the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Sentinel program.\citep{cutrona_validation_2013} The steps this group used to conduct the validation were as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Develop a PA for MI: They used the PA ``those with an ICD-9-CM code for AMI (410.x0, 410.x1) in the principal or primary position on facility claims for hospitalizations.''
\item
  Randomly select enough cases to be requested from the primary health care providers in order to achieve a sufficient successful return of records to achieve appropriate statistical precision for their performance measure, in this case PPV.
\item
  Request approximately an equal number of patient records from each of their four data providers.
\item
  Receive records from data providers redacted to ensure patient confidentiality.
\item
  Abstract the data from the records using the clinical expertise of two nurses. Abstracted information included EKG images, cardiac biomarkers, information on ischemic symptoms and results of cardiac diagnostic tests.
\item
  Test inter-rater reliability of the two data abstractors.
\item
  Develop an adjudication protocol based on standardized criteria from the joint European Society of Cardiology and American College of Cardiology Global Task Force
\item
  Review abstracted records using the clinical expertise of two cardiologists. The cardiologists were provided with all abstracted information listed above and an abstracted case summary. Detailed discharge information was not provided to the reviewers.
\item
  Classify each subject as: (1) definite MI; (2) probable MI; (3) no MI; or (4) unable to determine. Distinguishing between definite and probable was not defined for the clinicians but was to based on their own clinical judgement. Subjects were considered cases if the clinicians determined the subject to be definite or probable for MI.
\item
  Disagreement between the two clinicians, i.e., one clinician determining the subject to be definite or probable and the other either not an MI or unable to determine, was settled through a joint discussion between the clinicians until agreement could be reached.
\end{enumerate}

It appears evident that the above process is both very thorough as well as very time consuming and costly. In this example neither sensitivity nor specificity of the PA was determined likely owing to the cost of including records from a random selection of patients not determined to have an MI based on the PA. Overall the process examined the records of 143 of the 153 records requested. One advantage this group had was that patient permission was not required as the FDA Sentinel Initiative activities did not require institutional review board (IRB) approval. At the end of this process the researchers determined the PPV for this algorithm to be 86.0\% (95\% confidence interval; 79.2\%, 91.2\%).
The above study was included in a review of validation efforts for MI PAs by Rubbo et al.\citep{rubbo_use_2015} In this review, the authors examined 33 studies involving validation of phenotype algorithms for acute myocardial infarction. They found that there was significant heterogeneity in the phenotype algorithms used in the studies as well as in the validation methods and the results reported. The authors concluded that for acute myocardial infarction there is no gold standard phenotype algorithm available. They noted that the process was both costly and time consuming. Due to that limitation most studies had small sample sizes in their validation leading to wide variations in the estimates for the performance characteristics. They also noted that in the 33 studies, while all the studies reported positive predictive value, only 11 studies reported sensitivity and only five studies reported specificity. The question then needs to be asked is this really validation of the phenotype algorithm?
As discussed previously an alternative approach currently being developed in the OHDSI community is through the use of diagnostic predictive modeling tool using a tool called PheValuator. The following are the steps for testing PAs for MI using PheValuator:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Develop an extremely specific, xSpec, cohort to determine those with MI with a high probability. For MI, we used an occurrence of MI with one or more occurrences of MI recorded from a hospital in-patient visit within 5 days, and 4 or more occurrences of MI in the patient record within 365 days. The following illustrates this PA for MI:
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/ClinicalValidity/figure5} \end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Develop the diagnostic predictive model for MI
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Create a sample of subjects labeled as cases (from the xSpec cohort for MI) or non-cases in approximate proportion to the prevalence of MI in the population.
\item
  Use the OHDSI Patient Level Prediction package to develop a LASSO logistic regression model using all available data in the subject record.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item
  Randomly select 2M subjects from the database, the evaluation cohort, and apply the model to this cohort to determine the probability of MI in each subject.
\item
  Test possible algorithms for MI, e.g., 1 occurrence of MI in the patient record, using the evaluation cohort.
\item
  Compare performance characteristics for the various algorithms to determine the PA for MI for use within a study.
\end{enumerate}

Using this process, Table 1 displays the performance characteristics for four PAs for MI across five datasets. For a PA similar to the one evaluated by Cutrona and colleagues, ``\textgreater=1 X HOI, In-Patient'', we found a mean PPV of 67\% (range: 59\%-74\%).

\chapter{Software Validity}\label{SoftwareValidity}}

\emph{Chapter lead: Martijn Schuemie}

The central question of software validity is

\begin{quote}
Does the software do what it is expected to do?
\end{quote}

Software validity is an essential component of evidence quality: only if our analysis software does what it is expected to do can we produce reliable evidence. As described in Section \ref{automation}, it is essential to view every study as a software development exercise, creating an automated script that executes the entire analysis, from data in the Common Data Model (CDM) to the results such as estimates, figures as tables. It is this script, and any software used in this script, that must be validated. As described in Section \ref{analysisImplementation}, we can write te entire analysis as custom code, or we can use the functionality available in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}{OHDSI Methods Library}. The advantage of using the Methods Library is that great care has already been taken to ensure its validity, so establishing the validity of the entire analysis becomes less burdensome.

In this chapter we first describe best practices for writing valid analysis code. After this we discuss how the Methods library is validated through its software development process and testing.

\hypertarget{study-code-validity}{%
\section{Study code validity}\label{study-code-validity}}

\hypertarget{automation}{%
\subsection{Automation as a requirement for reproducibility}\label{automation}}

Traditionally, observational studies are often viewed as a journey rather than a process: a database expert may extract a data set from the database and hands this over to the data analyst, who may open it in a spreadsheet editor or other interactive tool, and starts working on the analysis. In the end, a result is produced, but little is preserved of how it came about. The destination of the journey was reached, but it is not possible to retrace the exact steps taken to get there. This practice is entirely unacceptable, both because it is not reproducible, but also because it lacks transparency; we do not know exactly what was done to produce the result, so we also cannot verify that no mistakes were made.

Every analysis generating evidence must therefore be fully automated. By automated we mean the analysis should be implemented as a single script, and we should be able to redo the entire analysis from database in CDM format to results, including tables and figures, with a single command. The analysis can be of arbitrary complexity, perhaps producing just a single count, or generating empirically calibrated estimates for millions of research questions, but the same principle applies. The script can invoke other scripts, which in turn can invoke even lower-level analysis processes.

The analysis script can be implemented in any computer language, although in OHDSI the preferred language is R. Thanks to the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/}{DatabaseConnector} R package, we can connect directly to the data in CDM format, and many advanced analytic are available through the other R packages in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}{OHDSI Methods Library}.

\hypertarget{programming-best-practices}{%
\subsection{Programming best practices}\label{programming-best-practices}}

Observational analyses can become very complex, with many steps needed to produce the final results. This complexity can make it harder to maintain the analysis code, and increase the likelihood of making errors as well as making it harder to notice errors. Luckily, computer programmers have over many years developed best practices for writing code that can deal with complexity, and is easy to read, reuse, adapt, and verify. \citep{Martin_2008} A full discussion of these best practices could fill many books. Here, we highlight these four import principles:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Abstraction}: Rather than write a single large script that does everything, leading to so-call ``spaghetti code'' where dependencies between lines of code can go from anywhere to anywhere (e.g.~a value set on line 10 is used in line 1,000), we can organize our code in units called ``functions''. A function should have a clear goal, for example ``take random sample'', and once created we can then use this function in our larger script without having to think of the minutiae of what the function does; We can abstract the function to a simple-to-understand concept.
\item
  \textbf{Encapsulation}: For abstraction to work, we should make sure that dependencies of a function are minimized and clearly defined. Our example sampling function should have a few arguments (e.g.~a dataset and a sample size), and one output (e.g.~the sample). Nothing else should influence what the function does. So-called ``global variables'', variables that are set outside a function, are not arguments of a function, but are nevertheless used in the function, should be avoided.
\item
  \textbf{Clear naming}: Variables and functions should have clear names, making code read almost like natural language. For example, instead of \texttt{x\ \textless{}-\ spl(y,\ 100)}, we can write code that reads \texttt{sampledPatients\ \textless{}-\ takeSample(patients,\ sampleSize\ =\ 100)}. Try to resist the urge to abbreviate. Modern languages have no limits on the length of variable and function names.
\item
  \textbf{Reuse}: One advantage of writing clear, well encapsulated functions is that they can often be reused. This not only saves time, it also means there will be less code, so less complexity and fewer opportunities for errors.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{code-validation}{%
\subsection{Code validation}\label{code-validation}}

Several approaches exist to verify the validity of software code, but two are especially relevant for code implementing an observational study:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Code review}: One person writes the code, and another person reviews the code.
\item
  \textbf{Double coding}: Two persons both independently write the analysis code, and afterwards the results of the two scripts are compared.
\end{itemize}

Code review has the advantage that it is usually less work, but the disadvantage is that the reviewer might miss some errors. Double coding on the other hand is usually very labor intensive, but it is less likely, although not impossible, that errors are missed. Another disadvantages of double coding is that two separate implementations \emph{almost always} produce different results, due to the many minor arbitrary choices that need to made (e.g.~should ``until exposure end'' be interpreted as including the exposure end date, or not?). As a consequence, the two supposedly independent programmers often need to work together to align their analyses, thus breaking their independence.

Other software validation practices such as unit testing are less relevant here because a study is typically a one-time activity with highly complex relationship between input (the data in CDM) and outputs (the study results), making these practices less usable. Note that these practices are applied in the Methods Library.

\hypertarget{using-the-methods-library}{%
\subsection{Using the Methods Library}\label{using-the-methods-library}}

The \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}{OHDSI Methods Library} provides a large set of functions, allowing most observational studies to be implemented using only a few lines of code. Using the Methods Library therefore shifts most of the burden of establishing the validity of one's study code to the Library. Validity of the Methods Library is ensured by its software development process, and by extensive testing.

\hypertarget{methods-library-software-development-process}{%
\section{Methods Library software development process}\label{methods-library-software-development-process}}

The OHDSI Methods Library is developed by the OHDSI community. Proposed changes to the Library are discussed in two venues: The GitHub issue trackers (for example the CohortMethod issue tracker\footnote{\url{https://github.com/OHDSI/CohortMethod/issues}}) and the OHDSI Forums\footnote{\url{http://forums.ohdsi.org/}}. Both are open to the public. Any member of the community can contribute software code to the Library, however, final approval of any changes incorporated in the released versions of the software is performed by the OHDSI Population-Level Estimation Workgroup leadership (Drs. Marc Suchard and Martijn Schuemie) and OHDSI Patient-Level Prediction Workgroup leadership (Drs. Peter Rijnbeek and Jenna Reps) only.

Users can install the Methods Library in R directly from the master branches in the GitHub repositories, or through a system known as ``drat'' that is always up-to-date with the master branches. A number of the Methods Library packages are available through R's Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and this number is expected to increase over time.

Reasonable software development and testing methodologies are employed by OHDSI to maximize the accuracy, reliability and consistency of the Methods Library performance. Importantly, as the Methods Library is released under the terms of the Apache License V2, all source code underlying the Methods Library, whether it be in R, C++, SQL, or Java is available for peer review by all members of the OHDSI community, and the public in general. Thus, all the functionality embodied within Methods Library is subject to continuous critique and improvement relative to its accuracy, reliability and consistency.

\hypertarget{source-code-management}{%
\subsection{Source Code Management}\label{source-code-management}}

All of the Methods Library's source code is managed in the source code version control system ``git'' publicly accessible via GitHub. The OHDSI Methods Library repositories are access-controlled. Anyone in the world can view the source code, and any member of the OHDSI community can submit changes through so-called pull requests. Only the OHDSI Population-Level Estimation Workgroup and Patient-Level Prediction Workgroup leadership can approve such request, make changes to the master branches, and release new versions. Continuous logs of code changes are maintained within the GitHub repositories and reflect all aspects of changes in code and documentation. These commit logs are available for public review.

New versions are released by the OHDSI Population-Level Estimation Workgroup and Patient-Level Prediction Workgroup leadership as needed. A new release starts by pushing changes to a master branch with a package version number (as defined in the DESCRIPTION file inside the package) that is greater than the version number of the previous release. This automatically triggers checking and testing of the package. If all tests are passed, the new version is automatically tagged in the version control system and the package is automatically uploaded to the OHDSI drat repository. New versions are numbered using three-component version number:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  New \textbf{micro versions} (e.g.~from 4.3.2 to 4.3.3) indicate bug fixes only. No new functionality, and forward and backward compatibility are guaranteed
\item
  New \textbf{minor versions} (e.g.~from 4.3.3 to 4.4.0) indicate added functionality. Only backward compatibility is guaranteed
\item
  New \textbf{major versions} (e.g.~from 4.4.0 to 5.0.0) indicate major revisions. No guarantees are made in terms of compatibility
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{documentation-2}{%
\subsection{Documentation}\label{documentation-2}}

All packages in the Methods Library are documented through R's internal documentation framework. Each package has a package manual that describes every function available in the package. To promote alignment between the function documentation and the function implementation, the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html}{roxygen2} software is used to combine a function's documentation and source code in a single file. The package manual is available on demand through R's command line interface, as a PDF in the package repositories, and as a web page. In addition, many packages also have vignettes that highlight specific use cases of a package. All documentation can be viewed though the Methods Library website\footnote{\url{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}}.

All Method Library source code is available to end users. Feedback from the community is facilitated using GitHub's issue tracking system and the OHDSI Forums.

\hypertarget{availability-of-current-and-historical-archive-versions}{%
\subsection{Availability of Current and Historical Archive Versions}\label{availability-of-current-and-historical-archive-versions}}

Current and historical versions of the Methods Library packages are available in two locations: First, the GitHub version control system contains the full development history of each package, and the state of a package at each point in time can be reconstructed and retrieved. Most importantly, each released version is tagged in GitHub. Second, the released R source packages are stored in the OHDSI GitHub drat repository.

\hypertarget{maintenance-support-and-retirement}{%
\subsection{Maintenance, Support and Retirement}\label{maintenance-support-and-retirement}}

Each current version of the Methods Library is actively supported by OHDSI with respect to bug reporting, fixes and patches. Issues can be reported through GitHub's issue tracking system, and through the OHDSI forums. Each package has a package manual, and zero, one or several vignettes. Online video tutorials are available, and in-person tutorials are provided from time to time.

\hypertarget{qualified-personnel}{%
\subsection{Qualified Personnel}\label{qualified-personnel}}

Members of OHDSI community represent multiple statistical disciplines and are based at academic, not-for-profit and industry-affiliated institutions on multiple continents.

All leaders of the OHDSI Population-Level Estimation Workgroup and OHDSI Patient-Level Prediction Workgroup hold PhDs from accredited academic institutions and have published extensively in peer reviewed journals.

\hypertarget{physical-and-logical-security}{%
\subsection{Physical and Logical Security}\label{physical-and-logical-security}}

The OHDSI Methods Library is hosted on the GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/}} system. GitHub's security measures are described at \url{https://github.com/security}. Usernames and passwords are required by all members of the OHDSI community contribute modifications to the Methods Library, and only the Population-Level Estimation Workgroup and Patient-Level Prediction Workgroup leadership can makes changes to the master branches. User accounts are limited in access based upon standard security policies and functional requirements.

\hypertarget{disaster-recovery}{%
\subsection{Disaster Recovery}\label{disaster-recovery}}

The OHDSI Methods Library is hosted on the GitHub system. GitHub's disaster recovery facilities are described at \url{https://github.com/security}.

\hypertarget{methods-library-testing}{%
\section{Methods Library testing}\label{methods-library-testing}}

We distinguish between two types of tests performed on the Methods Library: Tests for individual functions in the packages (so-called ``unit tests''), and tests for more complex functionality using simulations.

\hypertarget{unit-test}{%
\subsection{Unit test}\label{unit-test}}

A large set of automated validation tests is maintained and upgraded by OHDSI to enable the testing of source code against known data and known results. Each test begins with specifying some simple input data, then executes a function in one of the packages on this input, and evaluates whether the output is exactly what would be expected. For simple functions, the expected result is often obvious (for example when performing propensity score matching on example data containing only a few subjects), for more complicated functions the expected result may be generated using combinations of other functions available in R (for example, Cyclops, our large-scale regression engine, is tested among others by comparing results on simple problems with other regression routines in R). We aim for these tests in total to cover 100\% of the lines of executable source code.

These tests are automatically performed when changes are made to a package (specifically, when changes are pushed to the package repository). Any errors noted during testing automatically trigger emails to the leadership of the Workgroups, and must be resolved prior to release of a new version of a package. The source code and expected results for these tests are available for review and use in other applications as may be appropriate. These tests are also available to end users and/or system administrators and can be run as part of their installation process to provide further documentation and objective evidence as to the accuracy, reliability and consistency of their installation of the Methods Library.

\hypertarget{simulation}{%
\subsection{Simulation}\label{simulation}}

For more complex functionality it is not always obvious what the expected output should be given the input. In these cases simulations are sometimes used, generating input given a specific statistical model, and establishing whether the functionality produces results in line with this known model. For example, in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/SelfControlledCaseSeries/}{SelfControlledCaseSeries} package simulations are used to verify that the method is able to detect and appropriately model temporal trends in simulated data.

\chapter{Method Validity}\label{MethodValidity}}

\emph{Chapter lead: Martijn Schuemie}

When considering method validity we aim to answer the question

\begin{quote}
Is this method valid for answering this question?
\end{quote}

Where ``method'' includes not only the study design, but also the data and the implementation of the design. Method validity is therefore somewhat of a catch-all; It is often not possible to observe good method validity without good data quality, clinical validity, and software validity. Those aspects of evidence quality should have already been addressed separately before we consider method validity.

The core activity when establishing method validity is evaluating whether important assumptions in the analysis have been met. For example, we assume that propensity-score matching makes two populations comparable, but we need to evaluate whether this is the case. Where possible, empirical tests should be performed to verify these assumptions. We can for example generate diagnostics to show that our two populations are indeed comparable on a wide range of characteristics after matching. In OHDSI we have developed many standardized diagnostics that should be generated and evaluated whenever an analysis is performed.

In this chapter we will focus on the validity of methods use in population-level estimation. We will first briefly highlight some study design-specific diagnostics, and will then discuss diagnostics that are applicable to most if not all population-level estimation studies. Following this is a step-by-step description of how to execute these diagnostics using the OHDSI tools. We close this chapter with an advanced topic, reviewing the OHDSI Methods Benchmark and its application to the OHDSI Methods Library.

\hypertarget{design-specific-diagnostics}{%
\section{Design-specific diagnostics}\label{design-specific-diagnostics}}

For each study design there are diagnostics specific to such a design. Many of these diagnostics are implemented and readily available in the R packages of the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}{OHDSI Methods Library}. For example, Section \ref{studyOutputs} lists a wide range of diagnostics generated by the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortMethod/}{CohortMethod} package, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Propensity score distribution} to asses initial comparability of cohorts.
\item
  \textbf{Propensity model} to identify potential variables that should be excluded from the model.
\item
  \textbf{Covariate balance} to evaluate whether propensity score adjustment has made the cohorts comparable (as measured through baseline covariates).
\item
  \textbf{Attrition} to observe how many subjects were excluded in the various analysis steps, which may inform on the generalizability of the results to the initial cohorts of interest.
\item
  \textbf{Power} to assess whether enough data is available to answer the question.
\item
  \textbf{Kaplan Meier curve} to asses typical time to onset, and whether the proportionality assumption underlying Cox models is met.
\end{itemize}

Other study designs require different diagnostics to test the different assumptions in those designs. For example, for the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design we may check the necessary assumption that the end of observation is independent of the outcome. This assumption is often violated in the case of serious, potentially lethal, events such as myocardial infarction. We can evaluate whether the assumption holds by generating the plot shown in Figure \ref{fig:timeToObsEnd}, which shows histograms of the time to observation period end for those that are censored, and those that uncensored. In our data we consider those whose observation period ends at the end date of data capture (the date when observation stopped for the entire data base, for example the date of extraction, or the study end date) to be uncensored, and all others to be censored. In Figure \ref{fig:timeToObsEnd} we see only minor differences between the two distributions, suggesting our assumptions holds.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/MethodValidity/timeToObsEnd}

\caption{Time to observation end for those that are censored, and those that uncensored.}\label{fig:timeToObsEnd}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{diagnostics-for-all-estimation}{%
\section{Diagnostics for all estimation}\label{diagnostics-for-all-estimation}}

Next to the design-specific diagnostics, there are also several diagnostics that are applicable across all causal effect estimation methods. Many of these rely on the use of control hypotheses, research questions where the answer is already known. Using control hypotheses we can then evaluate whether our design produces results in line with the truth. Controls can be divided into negative controls and positive controls.

\hypertarget{NegativeControls}{%
\subsection{Negative controls}\label{NegativeControls}}

Negative controls are exposure-outcome pairs where one believes no causal effect exists, and including negative controls or ``falsification endpoints'' \citep{prased_2013} has been recommended as a means to detect confounding, \citep{lipsitch_2010} selection bias and measurement error. \citep{arnold_2016} For example, in one study \citep{zaadstra_2008} investigating the relationship between childhood diseases and later multiple sclerosis (MS), the authors include three negative controls that are not believed to cause MS: a broken arm, concussion, and tonsillectomy. Two of these three controls produce statistically significant associations with MS, suggesting that the study may be biased.

We should select negative controls that are comparable to our hypothesis of interest, which means we typically select exposure-outcome pairs that either have the same exposure as the hypothesis of interest (so-called ``outcome controls'') or the same outcome (``exposure controls''). Our negative controls should further meet these criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The exposure \textbf{should not cause} the outcome. One way to think of causation is to think of the counterfactual: could the outcome be caused (or prevented) if a patient was not exposed, compared to if the patient had been exposed? Sometimes this is clear, for example ACEi are known to cause angioedema. Other times this is far less obvious. For example, a drug that may cause hypertension can therefore indirectly cause cardiovascular diseases that are a consequence of the hypertension.
\item
  The exposure should also \textbf{not prevent or treat} the outcome. This is just another causal relationship that should be absent if we are to believe the true effect size (e.g.~the hazard ratio) is 1.
\item
  The negative control should \textbf{exist in the data}, ideally with sufficient numbers. We try to achieve this by prioritizing candidate negative controls based on prevalence.
\item
  Negative controls should ideally be \textbf{independent}. For example, we should avoid having negative controls that are either ancestors of each other (e.g.~``ingrown nail'' and ``ingrown nail of foot'') or siblings (e.g.~``fracture of left femur'' and ``fracture of right femur'').
\item
  Negative controls should ideally have \textbf{some potential for bias}. For example, the last digit of someone's social security number is basically a random number, and is unlikely to show confounding. It should therefore not be used as a negative control.
\end{itemize}

Some argue that negative controls should also have the same confounding structure as the exposure-outcome pair of interest. \citep{lipsitch_2010} However, we believe this confounding structure is unknowable; The relationships between variables found in reality is often far more complex than people imagine. Also, even if the confounder structure were known, it is unlikely that a negative control exists having that exact same confounding structure, but lacking the direct causal effect. For this reason in OHDSI we rely on a large number of negative controls, assuming that such a set represents many different types of bias, including the ones present in the hypothesis of interest.

The absence of a causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome is rarely documented. Instead, we often make the assumption that a lack of evidence of a relationship implies the lack of a relationship. This assumption is more likely to hold if the exposure and outcome have both been studies extensively, so a relationship could have been detected. For example, the lack of evidence for a completely novel drug likely implies a lack of knowledge, not the lack of a relationship. With this Principe in mind we have developed a semi-automated procedure for selecting negative controls \citep{voss_2016}. In brief, information from literature, product labels, and spontaneous reporting is automatically extracted and synthesized to produce a candidate list of negative controls. This list must then undergo manual review, not only to verify that the automated extraction was accurate, but also to impose additional criteria such as biological plausibility.

\hypertarget{PositiveControls}{%
\subsection{Positive controls}\label{PositiveControls}}

To understand the behavior of a method when the true relative risk is smaller or greater than one requires the use of positive controls, where the null is believed to not be true. Unfortunately, real positive controls for observational research tend to be problematic for three reasons. First, in most research contexts, for example when comparing the effect of two treatments, there is a paucity of positive controls relevant for that specific context. Second, even if positive controls are available, the magnitude of the effect size may not be known with great accuracy, and often depends on the population in which one measures it. Third, when treatments are widely known to cause a particular outcome, this shapes the behavior of physicians prescribing the treatment, for example by taking actions to mitigate the risk of unwanted outcomes, thereby rendering the positive controls useless as a means for evaluation. \citep{noren_2014}

In OHDSI we therefore use synthetic positive controls, \citep{schuemie_2018} created by modifying a negative control through injection of additional, simulated occurrences of the outcome during the time at risk of the exposure. For example, assume that, during exposure to ACEi, n occurrences of our negative control outcome ``ingrowing nail'' were observed. If we now add an additional n simulated occurrences during exposure, we have doubled the risk. Since this was a negative control, the relative risk compared to the counterfactual was one, but after injection, it becomes two.

One issue that stands important is the preservation of confounding. The negative controls may show strong confounding, but if we inject additional outcomes randomly, these new outcomes will not be confounded, and we may therefore be optimistic in our evaluation of our capacity to deal with confounding for positive controls. To preserve confounding, we want the new outcomes to show similar associations with baseline subject-specific covariates as the original outcomes. To achieve this, for each outcome we train a model to predict the survival rate with respect to the outcome during exposure using covariates captured prior to exposure. These covariates include demographics, as well as all recorded diagnoses, drug exposures, measurements, and medical procedures. An L1-regularized Poisson regression \citep{suchard_2013} using 10-fold cross-validation to select the regularization hyperparameter fits the prediction model. We then use the predicted rates to sample simulated outcomes during exposure to increase the true effect size to the desired magnitude. The resulting positive control thus contains both real and simulated outcomes.

Figure \ref{fig:posControlSynth} depicts this process. Note that although this procedure simulates several important sources of bias, it does not capture all. For example, some effects of measurement error are not present. The synthetic positive controls imply constant positive predictive value and sensitivity, which may not be true in reality.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/MethodValidity/posControlSynth} 

}

\caption{Synthesizing positive controls from negative controls.}\label{fig:posControlSynth}
\end{figure}

Although we refer to a single true ``effect size'' for each control, different methods estimate different statistics of the treatment effect. For negative controls, where we believe no causal effect exists, all such statistics, including the relative risk, hazard ratio, odds ratio, incidence rate ratio, both conditional and marginal, as well as the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT) and the overall average treatment effect (ATE) will be identical to 1. Our process for creating positive controls synthesizes outcomes with a constant incidence rate ratio over time and between patients, using a model conditioned on the patient where this ratio is held constant, up to the point where the marginal effect is achieved. The true effect size is thus guaranteed to hold as the marginal incidence rate ratio in the treated. Under the assumption that our outcome model used during synthesis is correct, this also holds for the conditional effect size and the ATE. Since all outcomes are rare, odds ratios are all but identical to the relative risk.

\hypertarget{metrics}{%
\subsection{Empirical evaluation}\label{metrics}}

Based on the estimates of a particular method for the negative and positive controls, we can then understand the operating characteristic by computing a range of metrics, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Area Under the receiver operator Curve (AUC)}: the ability to discriminate between positive and negative controls.
\item
  \textbf{Coverage}: how often the true effect size is within the 95\% confidence interval.
\item
  \textbf{Mean precision}: precision is computed as \(1/(standard\ error)^2\), higher precision means narrower confidence intervals. We use the geometric mean to account for the skewed distribution of the precision.
\item
  \textbf{Mean squared error (MSE)}: Mean squared error between the log of the effect size point-estimate and the log of the true effect size.
\item
  \textbf{Type 1 error}: For negative controls, how often was the null rejected (at \(\alpha = 0.05\)). This is equivalent to the false positive rate and \(1 - specificity\).
\item
  \textbf{Type 2 error}: For positive controls, how often was the null not rejected (at \(\alpha = 0.05\)). This is equivalent to the false negative rate and \(1 - sensitivity\).
\item
  \textbf{Non-estimable}: For how many of the controls was the method unable to produce an estimate? There can be various reasons why an estimate cannot be produced, for example because there were no subjects left after propensity score matching, or because no subjects remained having the outcome.
\end{itemize}

Depending on our use case, we can evaluate whether these operating characteristics are suitable for our goal. For example, if we wish to perform signal detection, we may care about type 1 and type 2 error, or if we are willing to modify our \(\alpha\) threshold, we may inspect the AUC instead.

\hypertarget{p-value-calibration}{%
\subsection{P-value calibration}\label{p-value-calibration}}

Often the type 1 error (at \(\alpha = 0.05\)) is larger than 5\%. In other words, we are often more likely than 5\% to reject the null hypothesis when in fact the null hypothesis is true. The reason is that the p-value only reflects random error, the error due to having a limited sample size. It does not reflect systematic error, for example the error due to confounding. OHDSI has developed a process for calibrating p-values to restore the type 1 error to nominal. \citep{schuemie_2014} We derive an empirical null distribution from the actual effect estimates for the negative controls. These negative control estimates give us an indication of what can be expected when the null hypothesis is true, and we use them to estimate an empirical null distribution.

Formally, we fit a Gaussian probability distribution to the estimates, taking into account the sampling error of each estimate. Let \(\hat{\theta}_i\) denote the estimated log effect estimate (relative risk, odds or incidence rate ratio) from the \(i\)th negative control drug--outcome pair, and let \(\hat{\tau}_i\) denote the corresponding estimated standard error, \(i=1,\ldots,n\). Let \(\theta_i\) denote the true log effect size (assumed 0 for negative controls), and let \(\beta_i\) denote the true (but unknown) bias associated with pair \(i\) , that is, the difference between the log of the true effect size and the log of the estimate that the study would have returned for control \(i\) had it been infinitely large. As in the standard p-value computation, we assume that \(\hat{\theta}_i\) is normally distributed with mean \(\theta_i + \beta_i\) and standard deviation \(\hat{\tau}_i^2\). Note that in traditional p-value calculation, \(\beta_i\) is always assumed to be equal to zero, but that we assume the \(\beta_i\)'s, arise from a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\). This represents the null (bias) distribution. We estimate \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^2\) via maximum likelihood. In summary, we assume the following:

\[\beta_i \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \text{  and} \\ \hat{\theta}_i \sim N(\theta_i + \beta_i, \tau_i^2)\]

where \(N(a,b)\) denotes a Gaussian distribution with mean \(a\) and variance \(b\), and estimate \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^2\) by maximizing the following likelihood:

\[L(\mu, \sigma | \theta, \tau) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{n}\int p(\hat{\theta}_i|\beta_i, \theta_i, \hat{\tau}_i)p(\beta_i|\mu, \sigma) \text{d}\beta_i\]

yielding maximum likelihood estimates \(\hat{\mu}\) and \(\hat{\sigma}\). We compute a calibrated p-value that uses the empirical null distribution. Let \(\hat{\theta}_{n+1}\) denote the log of the effect estimate from a new drug--outcome pair, and let \(\hat{\tau}_{n+1}\) denote the corresponding estimated standard error. From the aforementioned assumptions and assuming \(\beta_{n+1}\) arises from the same null distribution, we have the following:

\[\hat{\theta}_{n+1} \sim N(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma} + \hat{\tau}_{n+1})\]

When \(\hat{\theta}_{n+1}\) is smaller than \(\hat{\mu}\), the one-sided calibrated p-value for the new pair is then

\[\phi\left(\frac{\theta_{n+1} - \hat{\mu}}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2 + \hat{\tau}_{n+1}^2}}\right)\]

where \(\phi(\cdot)\) denotes the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. When \(\hat{\theta}_{n+1}\) is bigger than \(\hat{\mu}\), the one-sided calibrated p-value is then

\[1-\phi\left(\frac{\theta_{n+1} - \hat{\mu}}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2 + \hat{\tau}_{n+1}^2}}\right)\]

\hypertarget{confidence-interval-calibration}{%
\subsection{Confidence interval calibration}\label{confidence-interval-calibration}}

Similarly, we typically observe that the coverage of the 95\% confidence interval is less than 95\%: the true effect size is inside the 95\% confidence interval less than 95\% of the time. For confidence interval calibration \citep{schuemie_2018} we extend the framework for p-value calibration by also making use of our positive controls. Typically, but not necessarily, the calibrated confidence interval is wider than the nominal confidence interval, reflecting the problems unaccounted for in the standard procedure (such as unmeasured confounding, selection bias and measurement error) but accounted for in the calibration.

Formally, we assume that \(beta_i\), the bias associated with pair \(i\), again comes from a Gaussian distribution, but this time using a mean and standard deviation that are linearly related to \(theta_i\), the true effect size:

\[\beta_i \sim N(\mu(\theta_i) , \sigma^2(\theta_i))\]

where

\[\mu(\theta_i) = a + b \times \theta_i \text{ and} \\
  \sigma(\theta_i) ^2= c + d \times \mid \theta_i \mid\]

We estimate \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) by maximizing the marginalized likelihood in which we integrate out the unobserved \(\beta_i\):

\[l(a,b,c,d | \theta, \hat{\theta}, \hat{\tau} ) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{n}\int p(\hat{\theta}_i|\beta_i, \theta_i, \hat{\tau}_i)p(\beta_i|a,b,c,d,\theta_i) \text{d}\beta_i ,\]

yielding maximum likelihood estimates \((\hat{a}, \hat{b}, \hat{c}, \hat{d})\).

We compute a calibrated CI that uses the systematic error model. Let \(\hat{\theta}_{n+1}\) again denote the log of the effect estimate for a new outcome of interest, and let \(\hat{\tau}_{n+1}\) denote the corresponding estimated standard error. From the assumptions above, and assuming \(\beta_{n+1}\) arises from the same systematic error model, we have:

\[\hat{\theta}_{n+1} \sim N(
\theta_{n+1} + \hat{a} + \hat{b} \times \theta_{n+1},
\hat{c} + \hat{d} \times \mid \theta_{n+1} \mid) + \hat{\tau}_{n+1}^2) .\]

We find the lower bound of the calibrated 95\% CI by solving this equation for \(\theta_{n+1}\):

\[\Phi\left(
\frac{\theta_{n+1} + \hat{a} + \hat{b} \times \theta_{n+1}-\hat{\theta}_{n+1}}
{\sqrt{(\hat{c} + \hat{d} \times \mid \theta_{n+1} \mid) + \hat{\tau}_{n+1}^2}}
\right) = 0.025 ,\]

where \(\Phi(\cdot)\) denotes the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. We find the upper bound similarly for probability 0.975. We define the calibrated point estimate by using probability 0.5.

Both p-value calibration and confidence interval calibration are implemented in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/EmpiricalCalibration/}{EmpiricalCalibration} package.

\hypertarget{replication-across-sites}{%
\subsection{Replication across sites}\label{replication-across-sites}}

Another form of method validation comes from executing the study across several different databases that represent different populations, different health care systems, and/or different data capture processes. Prior research has shown that executing the same study design across different databases can produce vastly different effect size estimates, \citep{madigan_2013} suggesting that either the effect differs greatly for different populations, or that the design does not adequately address the different biases found in the different databases. In fact, we observe that accounting for residual bias in a database through empirical calibration of confidence intervals can greatly reduce between-study heterogeneity. \citep{schuemie_2018}

One way to express between-database heterogeneity is the \(I^2\) score, describing the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. \citep{higgins_2003} A naive categorization of values for \(I^2\) would not be appropriate for all circumstances, although one could tentatively assign adjectives of low, moderate, and high to \(I^2\) values of 25\%, 50\%, and 75\%. In a study estimating the effects for many depression treatments using a new-user cohort design with large-scale propensity score adjustment, \citet{schuemie_2018b} observed only 58\% of the estimates to have an \(I^2\) below 25\%. After empirical calibration this increased to 83\%.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
Observing between-database heterogeneity casts doubt on the validity of the estimates. Unfortunately, the inverse is not true. Not observing heterogeneity does not guarantee an unbiased estimate. It is not unlikely that all databases share a similar bias, and that all estimates are therefore consistently wrong.
\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

\hypertarget{sensitivity-analyses}{%
\subsection{Sensitivity analyses}\label{sensitivity-analyses}}

When designing a study there are often design choices that are uncertain. For example, should propensity score matching of stratification be used? If stratification is used, how many strata? What is the appropriate time-at-risk? When faced with such uncertainty, one solution is to evaluate various options, and observe the sensitivity of the results to the design choice. If the estimate remains the same under various options, we can say the study is robust to the uncertainty.

This definition of sensitivity analysis should not be confused with the definitions used by others such as \citet{rosenbaum_2005}, who define sensitivity analysis to ``appraise how the conclusions of a study might be altered by hidden biases of various magnitudes''.

\hypertarget{method-validation-in-practice}{%
\section{Method validation in practice}\label{method-validation-in-practice}}

Here we build on the example in Chapter \ref{PopulationLevelEstimation}, where we investigate the effect of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) on the risk of angioedema and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), compared to thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics (THZ). In that chapter we already explore many of the diagnostics specific to the design we used: the cohort method. Here, we apply additional diagnostics that could also have been applied had other designs been used. If the study is implemented using ATLAS as described in Section \ref{PleAtlas} these diagnostics are available in the Shiny app that is included in the study R package generated by ATLAS. If the study is implemented using R instead, as described in Section \ref{pleR}, then R functions available in the various packages should be used, as described in the next sections.

\hypertarget{selecting-negative-controls}{%
\subsection{Selecting negative controls}\label{selecting-negative-controls}}

We must select negative controls, exposure-outcome pairs where no causal effect is believed to exist. For comparative effect estimation such as our example study, we select negative control outcomes that are believed to be neither caused by the target nor the comparator exposure. We want enough negative controls to make sure we have a diverse mix of biases represented in the controls, and also to allow empirical calibration. As a rule-of-thumb we typically aim to have 50-100 such negative controls. We could come up with these controls completely manually, but fortunately ATLAS provides features to aid the selection of negative controls using data from literature, product labels, and spontaneous reports.

To generate a candidate list of negative controls, we first must create a concept set containing all exposures of interest. In this case we select all ingredients in the ACEi and THZ classes, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:exposuresConceptSet}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/MethodValidity/exposuresConceptSet} 

}

\caption{A concept set containing the concepts defining the target and comparator exposures.}\label{fig:exposuresConceptSet}
\end{figure}

Next, we go to the ``Explore Evidence'' tab, and click on the \includegraphics{images/MethodValidity/generate.png} button. Generating the evidence overview will take a few minutes, after which you can click on the \includegraphics{images/MethodValidity/viewEvidence.png} button. This will open the list of outcomes as shown in Figure \ref{fig:candidateNcs}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/MethodValidity/candidateNcs} 

}

\caption{Candidate control outcomes with an overview of the evidence found in literature, product labels, and spontaneous reports.}\label{fig:candidateNcs}
\end{figure}

This list shows condition concepts, along with an overview of the evidence linking the condition to any of the exposures we defined. For example, we see the number of publications that link the exposures to the outcomes found in PubMed using various strategies, the number of product labels of our exposures of interest that list the condition as a possible adverse effect, and the number of spontaneous reports. By default the list is sorted to show candidate negative controls first. It is then sorted by the ``Sort Order'', which represents the prevalence of the condition in a collection of observational databases. The higher the Sort Order, the higher the prevalence. Although the prevalence in these databases might not correspond with the prevalence in the database we wish to run the study, it is likely a good approximation.

The next step is to manually review the candidate list, typically starting at the top, so with the most prevalent condition, and working our way down until we are satisfied we have enough. One typical way to do this is to export the list to a CSV (comma separated values) file, and have clinicians review these, considering the criteria mentioned in Section \ref{NegativeControls}.

For our example study we select the 76 negative controls listed in Appendix \ref{AceiThzNsc}.

\hypertarget{including-controls}{%
\subsection{Including controls}\label{including-controls}}

Once we have defined our set of negative controls we must include them in our study. First we must define some logic for turning our negative control condition concepts into outcome cohorts. Section \ref{evaluationSettings} discusses how ATLAS allows creating such cohorts based on a few choices the user must make. Often we simply choose to create a cohort based on any occurrence of a negative control concept or any of its descendants. If the study is implemented in R then SQL (Structured Query Language) can be used to construct the negative control cohorts. Chapter \ref{SqlAndR} describes how cohorts can be created using SQL and R. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to write the appropriate SQL and R.

The OHDSI tools also provide functionality for automatically generating and including positive controls derived from the negative controls. This functionality can be found in the Evaluation Settings section in ATLAS described in Section \ref{evaluationSettings}, and is implemented in the \texttt{injectSignals} function in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodEvaluation/}{MethodEvaluation} package. Here we generate three positive controls for each negative control, with true effect sizes of 1.5, 2, and 4, using a survival model:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that we must mimic the time-at-risk settings used in our estimation study design. The \texttt{injectSignals} function will extract information about the exposures and negative controls outcomes, fit outcome models per exposure-outcome pair, and synthesize outcomes. The positive control outcome cohorts will be added to the cohort table specified by \texttt{cohortDbSchema} and \texttt{cohortTable}. The resulting \texttt{pcs} data frame contains the information on the synthesized positive controls.

Next we must execute the same study used to estimate the effect of interest to also estimate effects for the negative and positive controls. Setting the set of negative controls in the comparisons dialog in ATLAS instructs ATLAS to compute estimates for these controls. Similarly, specifying that positive controls be generated in the Evaluation Settings includes these in our analysis. In R, the negative and positive controls should be treated as any other outcome. All estimation packages in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodsLibrary/}{OHDSI Methods Library} readily allow estimation of many effects in an efficient manner.

\hypertarget{empirical-performance}{%
\subsection{Empirical performance}\label{empirical-performance}}

Figure \ref{fig:controls} shows the estimated effect sizes for the negative and positive controls included in our example study, stratified by true effect size. This plot is included in the Shiny app that comes with the study R package generated by ATLAS, and can be generated using the \texttt{plotControls} function in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodEvaluation/}{MethodEvaluation} package. Note that the number of controls is often lower than what was defined because there was not enough data to either produce an estimate, or to synthesize a positive control.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/MethodValidity/controls} 

}

\caption{Estimates for the negative (true hazard ratio = 1) and positive controls (true hazard ratio > 1). Each dot represents a control. Estimates below the dashed line have a confidence interval that doesn't include the true effect size.}\label{fig:controls}
\end{figure}

Based on these estimates we can compute the metrics shown in Table \ref{tab:exampleMetrics} using the \texttt{computeMetrics} function in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodEvaluation/}{MethodEvaluation} package.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lr@{}}
\caption{\label{tab:exampleMetrics} Method performance metrics derived from the negative and positive control estimates.}\tabularnewline

Type 1 error & 0.00\tabularnewline
Type 2 error & 0.18\tabularnewline

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

We see that coverage and type 1 error are very close to their nominal values of 95\% and 5\%, respectively, and that the AUC is very high. This is certainly not always the case.

Note that although in Figure \ref{fig:controls} not all confidence intervals include one when the true hazard ratio is one, the type 1 error in Table \ref{tab:exampleMetrics} is 0\%. This is an exceptional situation, caused by the fact that confidence intervals in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/Cyclops/}{Cyclops} package are estimated using likelihood profiling, which is more accurate than traditional methods but can result in asymmetric confidence intervals. The p-value instead is computed assuming symmetrical confidence intervals, and this is what was used to compute the type 1 error.

\hypertarget{p-value-calibration-1}{%
\subsection{P-value calibration}\label{p-value-calibration-1}}

We can use the estimates for our negative controls to calibrate our p-values. This is done automatically in the Shiny app, and can be done manually in R. Assuming we have created the summary object \texttt{summ} as described in Section \ref{MultipleAnalyses}, we can plot the empirical calibration effect plot:

\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/MethodValidity/pValueCal}

\caption{P-value calibration: estimates below the dashed line have a conventional p < 0.05. Estimates in the orange area have calibrated p < 0.05. The pink area denotes the 95\% credible interval around the edge of the orange area. Blue dots indicate negative controls. Yellow diamonds indicate outcomes of interest.}\label{fig:pValueCal}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:pValueCal} we see that the orange area almost exactly overlaps with the area denoted by the dashed lines, indicated hardly any bias was observed for the negative controls. One of the outcomes of interest (AMI) is above the dashed line and the orange area, indicating we cannot reject the null according to both the uncalibrated and calibrated p-value. The other outcome (angioedema) clearly stands out from the negative control, and falls well within the area where both uncalibrated and calibrated p-values are smaller than 0.05.

We can compute the calibrated p-values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{null <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{fitNull}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{logRr =}\NormalTok{ ncEstimates}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{logRr,}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 1.604351e-06 7.159506e-01

And contrast these with the uncalibrated p-values:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{oiEstimates}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{p}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] [1] 1.483652e-06 7.052822e-01
\end{verbatim}

As expected, because little to no bias was observed, the uncalibrated and calibrated p-values are very similar.

\hypertarget{confidence-interval-calibration-1}{%
\subsection{Confidence interval calibration}\label{confidence-interval-calibration-1}}

Similarly, we can use the estimates for our negative and positive controls to calibrate the confidence intervals. The Shiny app automatically reports the calibrate confidence intervals. In R we can calibrate intervals using the \texttt{fitSystematicErrorModel} and \texttt{calibrateConfidenceInterval} functions in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/EmpiricalCalibration/}{EmpiricalCalibration} package, as described in detail in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/EmpiricalCalibration/articles/EmpiricalCiCalibrationVignette.html}{``Empirical calibration of confidence intervals'' vignette}.

Before calibration, the estimated hazard ratios (95\% confidence interval) are 4.32 (2.45 - 8.08) and 1.13 (0.59 - 2.18), for angioedema and AMI respectively. The calibrated hazard ratios are 4.75 (2.52 - 9.04) and 1.15 (0.58 - 2.30).

\hypertarget{between-database-heterogeneity}{%
\subsection{Between-database heterogeneity}\label{between-database-heterogeneity}}

Just as we executed our analysis on one database, in this case the IBM MarketScan Medicaid (MDCD) database, we can also run the same analysis code on other databases that adhere to the Common Data Model (CDM). Figure \ref{fig:forest} shows the forest plot and meta-analytic estimates (assuming random effects) \citep{dersimonian_1986} across a total of five databases for the outcome of angioedema. This figure was generated using the \texttt{plotMetaAnalysisForest} function in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/EvidenceSynthesis/}{EvidenceSynthesis} package.

Although all confidence intervals are above one, suggesting agreement on the fact that there is an effect, the \(I^2\) suggests between-database heterogeneity. However, if we compute the \(I^2\) using the calibrated confidence intervals as shown in Figure \ref{fig:forestCal}, we see that this heterogeneity can be explained by the bias measured in each database through the negative and positive controls. The empirical calibration appears to properly taken this bias into account.

\subsection{Sensitivity analyses}\label{sensitivity-analyses-1}}

One of the design choices in our analysis was to use variable-ratio matching on the propensity score. However, we could have also used stratification on the propensity score. Because we we are uncertain about this choice, we may decide to use both. Table \ref{tab:sensAnalysis} shows the effect size estimates for AMI and angioedema, both calibrated and uncalibrated, when using variable-ratio matching and stratification (with 10 equally-sized strata).

We see that the estimates from the matched and stratified analysis are in strong agreement, with the confidence intervals for stratification falling completely inside of the confidence intervals for matching. This suggests that our uncertainty around this design choice does not impact the validity of our estimates. Stratification does appear to give us more power (narrower confidence intervals), which is not surprising since matching results in loss of data, whereas stratification does not. The price for this could be an increase in bias, due to within-strata residual confounding, although we see no evidence of increased bias reflected in the calibrated confidence intervals.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
Study diagnostics allow us to evaluate design choices even before fully executing a study. It is recommended not to finalize the protocol before generating and reviewing all study diagnostics. To avoid p-hacking (adjusting the design to achieve a desired result), this should be done while blinded to the effect size estimate of interest.

\hypertarget{ohdsi-methods-benchmark}{%
\section{OHDSI Methods Benchmark}\label{ohdsi-methods-benchmark}}

Although the recommended practice is to empirically evaluate a method's performance within the context that it is applied, using negative and positive controls that are in ways similar to the exposures-outcomes pairs of interest (for example using the same exposure or the same outcome) and on the database used in the study, there is also value in evaluating a method's performance in general. This is why the OHDSI Methods Evaluation Benchmark was developed. The benchmark evaluates performance using a wide range of control questions, including those with chronic or acute outcomes, and long-term or short-term exposures. The results on this benchmark can help demonstrate the overall usefulness of a method, and can be used to form a prior belief about the performance of a method when a context-specific empirical evaluation is not (yet) available. The benchmark consists of 200 carefully selected negative controls that can be stratified into eight categories, with the controls in each category either sharing the same exposure or the same outcome. From these 200 negative controls, 600 synthetic positive controls are derived as described in Section \ref{PositiveControls}. To evaluate a method, it must be used to produce effect size estimates for all controls, after which the metrics described in Section \ref{metrics} can be computed. The benchmark is publicly available, and can be deployed as described in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodEvaluation/articles/OhdsiMethodsBenchmark.html}{Running the OHDSI Methods Benchmark vignette} in the \href{https://ohdsi.github.io/MethodEvaluation/}{MethodEvaluation} package.

We have run all the methods in the OHDSI Methods Library through this benchmark, with various analysis choices per method. For example, the cohort method was evaluated using propensity score matching, stratification, and weighting. This experiment was executed on four large observational healthcare databases. The results, viewable in an online Shiny app\footnote{\url{http://data.ohdsi.org/MethodEvalViewer/}}, show that although several methods show high AUC (the ability to distinguish positive controls from negative controls), most methods in most settings demonstrate high type 1 error and low coverage of the 95\% confidence interval, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:methodEval}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/MethodValidity/methodEval} 

}

\caption{Coverage of the 95\% confidence interval for the methods in the Methods Library. Each dot represents the performance of a specific set of analysis choices. The dashed line indicates nominal performance (95\% coverage). SCCS = Self-Controlled Case Series, GI = Gastrointestinal, IBD = inflammatory bowel disease.}\label{fig:methodEval}
\end{figure}

This emphasizes the need for empirical evaluation and calibration: if no empirical evaluation is performed, which is true for almost all published observational studies, we must assume a prior informed by the results in Figure \ref{fig:methodEval}, and conclude that it is likely that the true effect size is not contained in the 95\% confidence interval!

Our evaluation of the designs in the Methods Library also shows that empirical calibration restores type 1 error and coverage to their nominal values, although often at the cost of increasing type 2 error and decreasing precision.

\hypertarget{summary-10}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-10}}

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdsummary}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  A method's validity depends on whether the assumptions underlying the method are met.
\item
  Where possible, these assumptions should be empirically tested using study diagnostics.
\item
  Control hypotheses, questions where the answer is known, should be used to evaluate whether a specific study design produces answers in line with the truth.
\item
  Often, p-values and confidence intervals do not demonstrate nominal characteristics as measured using control hypotheses.
\item
  These characteristics can often be restored to nominal using empirical calibration.
\item
  Study diagnostics can be used to guide analytic design choices and adapt the protocol, as long as the researcher remains blinded to the effect of interest to avoid p-hacking.

\chapter{OHDSI Network Research}\label{NetworkResearch}}

Contributors: Greg Klebanov, Kristin Kostka \& Vojtech Huser

The mission of OHDSI is to generate high-quality evidence through observational research. A primary way this is accomplished is through collaborative research studies. In prior chapters we discussed how the OHDSI community has authored standards and tools to facilitate high-quality, reproducible research, including Standardized Vocabularies , the Common Data Model (CDM) , analytical methods packages, ATLAS and the study steps (Chapter\ref{StudySteps}) to run a retrospective database study. OHDSI Network Studies represent the culmination of a transparent, consistent and reproducible way to conduct research across a large number of geographically dispersed data. In this chapter we will discuss what constitutes an OHDSI network study, how to run a network study and discuss enabling technologies such as the ARACHNE Research Network.

\hypertarget{what-is-the-ohdsi-research-network}{%
\section{What is the OHDSI Research Network?}\label{what-is-the-ohdsi-research-network}}

The OHDSI Research Network is an international collaboration of researchers seeking to advance observational data research in healthcare. Today, the network consists of over 1.2 billion patient records (\textasciitilde650 million de-duplicated patient records) in the OMOP CDM. This includes more than 200 researchers and 82 observational health databases across 17 countries with regional central coordinating centers housed at Columbia University (USA), Erasmus Medical Center (Europe) and Ajou University (South Korea). The OHDSI community continues to grow rapidly across Europe (in collaboration with the IMI EHDEN project), Central America (e.g.~Argentina, Brazil, Colombia), and Asia (e.g.~China, Japan, Singapore).

OHDSI is open network, inviting healthcare institutions across the globe with active patient data to join the network and convert data to the OMOP CDM. As OMOP data conversions are complete, collaborators are invited to report site information in the Data Network census maintained by the OHDSI Program Manager (\href{mailto:beaton@ohdsi.org}{\nolinkurl{beaton@ohdsi.org}}). Each OHDSI network site participates voluntarily. There are no hard obligations. Each site opts-in to each respective network study. In each study, data remains at the site behind a firewall. No data pooling across network sites. Only aggregate results are shared.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
\textbf{Benefits of Joining the OHDSI Network}
Unlock the power of institutional data: Transforming institutional EHR data in the OMOP Common Data Model enables clinical research on populations of your patients, something EHR systems don't support.
Access to free tools: OHDSI publishes free, open source tools for data characterization and analytics (e.g.~browsing the clinical concepts, defining and characterizing cohorts, running Population-Level Estimation and Patient-Level Prediction studies).
Participate in a premier research community: Author and publish network research, gain access to eminent leaders in global real-world evidence community.
Buildout Quality Benchmarks: Network can validate quality improvement benchmarks against other institutions (e.g.~On average how long does it take to get an appendectomy discharged?)

\section{What is an OHDSI Network Study?}\label{what-is-an-ohdsi-network-study}}

In the study steps chapter (Chapter\ref{StudySteps}), we discussed the steps to execute a retrospective database study using the OMOP CDM. A study may be conducted on a single OMOP CDM or on multiple OMOP CDMs. It can be conducted within a single institution's OMOP CDM data or across many institutions. There is no requirement that an OHDSI research study package be shared across the entire OMOP network. In fact, there may be legitimate instances when a study protocol is written for specific clinical practice that cannot be generalized to the entirety of the network. The principal investigator of each OHDSI research study will determine which, if any, sites they would like to include in an analysis.

\BeginKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}
\textbf{When is a study considered a network study?} An OHDSI research project becomes a network study when it is published and shared for execution across the OHDSI community.

Elements of a Network Study:
- Must have a protocol (a description of the analysis to be performed)
- Must have a study code package designed for the OMOP CDM
- Must be executed across two or more network sites (not just 2 or more databases at a single site)
- Encouraged to publish all documentation on GitHub
- At the end of the analysis, the results are made available in Github or other public repository (e.g.~a Shiny Application)

\section{Executing an OHDSI Network Study}\label{executing-an-ohdsi-network-study}}

Conducting an OHDSI Network Study requires a substantial amount of preparation to ensure success.

\EndKnitrBlock{rmdimportant}

Running an OHDSI Network Study has three distinct stages:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Study Feasibility and Design
\item
  Study Execution
\item
  Results Dissemination and Publication
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{study-feasibility-and-design}{%
\subsection{Study Feasibility and Design}\label{study-feasibility-and-design}}

The study feasibility stage \emph{(pre-study stage)} is focused on supporting a definition of a study and a creation of the study protocol, \emph{e.g.~undertaking activities to make sure the study is feasible to be executed as described in the formal protocol.}

The feasibility stage does not have a well-defined process but rather is driven by various supporting activities, including identification and enrollment of relevant databases that contain the targeted patient population with required drug exposure, procedure information, condition or demographics information through data characterization, validating and agreeing on target analytical methods and algorithms. These activities may involve sharing JSON files of cohort definitions from ATLAS and provisional test of study R packages. A study lead may have enough data to do this inside their own organization or may opt for support from other OHDSI network sites.

The outcome of the feasibility stage is generation of a final protocol as well as a list of target collaborators. The formal protocol will detail the study team, including the designated study lead (often the corresponding author for publication purposes), and information on the timeline for the study. The protocol is a critical component for additional network sites to review, approve and execute the study package on their OMOP CDM data. A protocol must include information on study population, the methods being used, how the results will be stored and analyzed as well as how the study results will be disseminated after completion (e.g.~a publication, a poster, etc).

\hypertarget{study-execution}{%
\subsection{Study Execution}\label{study-execution}}

After completing feasibility, a study advances to the execution phase. The key activities in executing a network study include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The study lead formally initiates a new OHDSI network study with the OHDSI Coordinating Center. \emph{In tandem, this may include undertaking other organization-specific processes to approve an OHDSI study.}
\item
  The study lead publishes the study protocol to the OHDSI GitHub.
\item
  The study lead announces the study on the OHDSI Community Call and OHDSI Forum, inviting participating centers and collaborators.
\item
  Study participating organizations assemble teams within each site, assign study roles (e.g.~data analyst(s) executing the study package, site leadership reviewing the study design and manuscript).
\item
  The data scientist/statisticians for the study lead will use a study protocol to design study analyses and generate study code.
\item
  The data scientist/statisticians will conduct a feasibility test of study code within their own environment. The package will be shared to 1-2 network sites for additional validation.
\item
  The data scientist/statistician will publish the validated study code in the OHDSI GitHub for execution at participating sites.
\item
  Site data scientists/statisticians access the OHDSI study package and generate results in the standardized format following OHDSI guidelines. Each participating site will follow internal institutional processes regarding data sharing rules. \textbf{Sites should not share results unless approval is obtained from IRB or other institutional approval processes.}
\item
  Data scientist/statisticians and Study Lead collect and review the analysis execution results.
\item
  Iterate steps 5-7, if reasonable adjustments required.
\item
  Collaboratively finalize study results. Study lead disseminates study results (e.g.~a Shiny Application).
\item
  Study lead formally closes the study out with OHDSI Coordinating Center.
\end{itemize}

While OHDSI processes can be executed rapidly, it is advised to allow for a few weeks to months for all participating sites to execute the study and receive appropriate approvals to publish results. A study leads should set study milestones and anticipated closure date in advance to assist with managing the overall study timeline.

\hypertarget{results-dissemination-and-publication}{%
\subsection{Results Dissemination and Publication}\label{results-dissemination-and-publication}}

During this stage, the study lead will collaborate with other sites on various administrative tasks, such as manuscript development and optimizing data visualizations.

Researchers are also invited to present OHDSI Network Studies on weekly OHDSI community calls and at OHDSI Symposiums across the globe.

\hypertarget{types-of-network-studies}{%
\section{Types of Network Studies}\label{types-of-network-studies}}

The network studies can be of different types - ranging from simple characterization questions to more advanced predictive studies. A large number of studies conducted today are focused on epidemiology and drug efficacy and safety and thus carry different type of characterization analyses such as patient population characterization, incidence rates of certain outcomes/conditions, comparative drug effectiveness comparison, prevalence of disease and similar. However, more and more studies cary predictive nature including the probability of an outcome for a certain type of a patient (personalized medicine).

\hypertarget{forward-looking-using-network-study-automation}{%
\section{Forward Looking: Using Network Study Automation}\label{forward-looking-using-network-study-automation}}

The current network study process is manual and rudimentary - with study team members using various mechanisms (including Wiki, GitHub and email) to collaborate on study design, share code and results. This process is not consistent and scalable and to solve that issue, the OHDSI community is actively working to systemize study processes. The ARACHNE Research Network platform is a community-driven solution to streamline and automate the process of network studies.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/NetworkStudies/ARACHNE} \caption{The ARACHNE Network Study Process.}\label{fig:arachne}
\end{figure}

The ARACHNE Platform includes multiple core components:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{ARACHNE Data Catalog} where different network participants register and maintain information about data sets available for network research
\item
  The \textbf{Study Workflow Manager} that allows study teams to orchestrate and end to end network study process. The ARACHNE Research Network platform It is taking full advantage of OHDSI standards and establishes a consistent, transparent, secure and compliant observational research process, across multiple organizations. ARACHNE standardizes the communication protocol to access the data and exchange analysis results, while enabling authentication and authorization for restricted content. It brings participating organizations - data providers, investigators, sponsors and data scientists - into a single collaborative study team and facilitates an end-to-end observational study. The tool enables the creation of a complete, standards-based R, Python and SQL execution environment including approval workflows controlled by the data custodian.
\end{itemize}

ARACHNE is built to provide a seamless integration with other OHDSI tools, including ACHILLES reports and an ability to import ATLAS design artefacts, create self-contained packages and automatically execute those across multiple sites. The future vision is to eventually enable multiple networks to be linked together for the purpose of conducting research not only between organizations within a single network, but also between organizations across multiple networks.

\hypertarget{best-practices-for-network-research}{%
\section{Best Practices for Network Research}\label{best-practices-for-network-research}}

There are multiple best practices that study teams should be following while executing the network study:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Make sure that study questions can be supported by data available. Perform study feasibility to identify the best databases.
\item
  Write code in generic way and parametrize all functions and variables e.g.~do not hard database connection, local hard drive path, assume a certain operating system.
\item
  Ensure the target databases have required OMOP CDM version and OMOP Standardized Vocabularies.
\item
  Ensure the target database ETL has followed THEMIS business rules and conventions and correct data was placed into correct CDM tables and fields.
\item
  Do not tweak the study code to get desired results

Cohort
A cohort is a list of person\_ids with start and end date. It is stored in a study specific cohort table or a CDM specified cohort table can also be used. Cohort can be represented as .json file. It is used for import and export but not during an analysis. OHDSI tools use SQL so Atlas also generates a .sql file that creates the cohort during analysis.

\hypertarget{SqlAndRanswers}{%
\section{SQL and R}\label{SqlAndRanswers}}

\textbf{Exercise \ref{exr:exercisePeopleCount}}

To compute the number of people we can simply query the PERSON table:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(DatabaseConnector)}
\NormalTok{connection <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{connect}\NormalTok{(connectionDetails)}
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT COUNT(*) AS person_count}
\StringTok{FROM @cdm.person;"}

\KeywordTok{renderTranslateQuerySql}\NormalTok{(connection, sql, }\DataTypeTok{cdm =} \StringTok{"main"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##   PERSON_COUNT
## 1         2694
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Exercise \ref{exr:exerciseCelecoxibUsers}}

To compute the number of people with at least one prescription of celecoxib, we can query the DRUG\_EXPOSURE table. To find all drugs containing the ingredient celecoxib, we join to the CONCEPT\_ANCESTOR and CONCEPT tables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(DatabaseConnector)}
\NormalTok{connection <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{connect}\NormalTok{(connectionDetails)}
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(person_id)) AS person_count}
\StringTok{FROM @cdm.drug_exposure}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm.concept_ancestor}
\StringTok{  ON drug_concept_id = descendant_concept_id}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm.concept ingredient}
\StringTok{  ON ancestor_concept_id = ingredient.concept_id}
\StringTok{WHERE LOWER(ingredient.concept_name) = 'celecoxib'}
\StringTok{  AND ingredient.concept_class_id = 'Ingredient'}
\StringTok{  AND ingredient.standard_concept = 'S';"}

\KeywordTok{renderTranslateQuerySql}\NormalTok{(connection, sql, }\DataTypeTok{cdm =} \StringTok{"main"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##   PERSON_COUNT
## 1         1844
\end{verbatim}

Note that we use \texttt{COUNT(DISTINCT(person\_id))} to find the number of distinct persons, considering that a person might have more than one prescription. Also note that we use the \texttt{LOWER} function to make our search for ``celecoxib'' case-insensitive.

Alternatively, we can use the DRUG\_ERA table, which is already rolled up to the ingredient level:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(DatabaseConnector)}
\NormalTok{connection <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{connect}\NormalTok{(connectionDetails)}

\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(person_id)) AS person_count}
\StringTok{FROM @cdm.drug_era}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm.concept ingredient}
\StringTok{  ON drug_concept_id = ingredient.concept_id}
\StringTok{WHERE LOWER(ingredient.concept_name) = 'celecoxib'}
\StringTok{  AND ingredient.concept_class_id = 'Ingredient'}
\StringTok{  AND ingredient.standard_concept = 'S';"}

\KeywordTok{renderTranslateQuerySql}\NormalTok{(connection, sql, }\DataTypeTok{cdm =} \StringTok{"main"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
##   PERSON_COUNT
## 1         1844
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Exercise \ref{exr:exerciseGiBleedsDuringCelecoxib}}

To compute the number of diagnoses during exposure we extend our previous query by joining to the CONDITION\_OCCURRENCE table. We join to the CONCEPT\_ANCESTOR table to find all condition concepts that imply a gastrointestinal haemorrhage:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(DatabaseConnector)}
\NormalTok{connection <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{connect}\NormalTok{(connectionDetails)}
\NormalTok{sql <-}\StringTok{ "SELECT COUNT(*) AS diagnose_count}
\StringTok{FROM @cdm.drug_era}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm.concept ingredient}
\StringTok{  ON drug_concept_id = ingredient.concept_id}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm.condition_occurrence}
\StringTok{  ON condition_start_date >= drug_era_start_date}
\StringTok{    AND condition_start_date <= drug_era_end_date}
\StringTok{INNER JOIN @cdm.concept_ancestor }
\StringTok{  ON condition_concept_id =descendant_concept_id}
\StringTok{WHERE LOWER(ingredient.concept_name) = 'celecoxib'}
\StringTok{  AND ingredient.concept_class_id = 'Ingredient'}
\StringTok{  AND ingredient.standard_concept = 'S'}
\StringTok{  AND ancestor_concept_id = 192671;"}

\KeywordTok{renderTranslateQuerySql}\NormalTok{(connection, sql, }\DataTypeTok{cdm =} \StringTok{"main"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}

Note that in this case it is essential to use the DRUG\_ERA table instead of the DRUG\_EXPOSURE table, because drug exposures with the same ingredient can overlap, but drug eras can. This could lead to double counting. For example, imagine a person received two drug drugs containing celecoxib at the same time. This would be recorded as two drug exposures, so any diagnoses occurring during the exposure would be counted twice. The two exposures will be merged into a single non-overlapping drug era.
