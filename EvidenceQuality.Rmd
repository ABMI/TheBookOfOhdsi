While the topic of "data quality" is often discussed in the context of observational data, the OHDSI community takes a holistic view on the subject of quality.  Specifically, OHDSI seeks to recognize, evaluate, and optimize the diverse set of processes necessary to achieve the highest quality reproducible evidence from diverse data sources.  

As such, we frame the discussion in terms of "Evidence Quality", which is derived from establishing validity along four dimensions:

* [Data Quality](DataQuality.html) (ie data validity)
* [Clinical Validity](ClinicalValidity.html)
* [Software Validity](SoftwareValidity.html)
* [Method Validity](MethodValidity.html)

In this chapter, we will review each of these components and discuss how OHDSI tools, conventions, and community support their evaluation and improvement.
