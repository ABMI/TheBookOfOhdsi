# Where to begin {#WhereToBegin}

This chapter will discuss where to begin if one is new in OHDSI. For various activities, we can describe how one might get started. 

For example, if interested in doing a network study, these are the steps. Same for interests in methods research, grant writing, etc.

Add a diagram that shows what tools are used for which steps?
