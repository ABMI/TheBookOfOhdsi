# Data Analytics Use Cases {#DataAnalyticsUseCases}

* Introduction

The OHDSI collaboration focuses on generating reliable evidence from real-world healthcare data, typically in the form of claims databases or electronic health record databases. The use cases that OHDSI focuses on fall into three major buckets and we describe these below. Note, for all the use cases, the evidence we generate inherits the limitations of the data; we discuss these limitations at length in Chapters X, Y, and Z. 

* Theory

1. Population characterization

We can use the data to provide answers to question about the charateristics of the patients in each datbase, the practice of healthcare, and the study how these things change over time.

The data can provide answers to questions like:
- for patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, how many receive a prescription for warfarin?

2. Population-level estimation

3. Patient-Level prediction

What is the difference between these

What use cases are often observed? Drug safety, Drug utilization, etc.

What type of questions can be answered by the data, and what type can't?

Discuss missingness in observational data?

* Practice
