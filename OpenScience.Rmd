# Open Science {#OpenScience}

From the inception of the OHDSI community, the goal was to establish an international collaborative by building on open science values, such as the use of open source software, public availability of all conference proceedings and materials, and transparent, open access publication of generated medical evidence. But what exactly is open science? And how could OHDSI build an open science or open data strategy around medical data, which is very privacy sensitive and typically not open at all for good reasons? Why is it so important to have reproducibility of analysis, and how does the OHDSI community aim to achieve this? These are some of the questions that we touch on in this chapter.

## Open Science

The term 'open science' has been used since the nineties, but really gained traction in the 2010s, during the same period OHDSI was born. Wikipedia [@wiki:Open_science] defines it as "the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional", and goes on to state that it is typically developed through collaborative networks. Although the OHDSI community never positioned itself explicitly as an 'open science' collective or network, the term is frequently used to explain the driving concepts and principles behind OHDSI. For example, in 2015, Jon Duke presented OHDSI as "An Open Science Approach to Medical Evidence Generation"[^1], and in 2019, the EHDEN projects' introductory webinar hailed the OHDSI network approach as "21st Century Real World Open Science"[^2]. Indeed, as we shall see in this chapter, many of the practices of open science can be found in today's OHDSI community. One could argue that the OHDSI community is a grassroots open science collective driven by a shared desire for improving the transparency and reliability of medical evidence generation.

Two important drivers for open science are the increased public scrutiny and call for transparency for scientific funding, and the crisis of the scientific practice itself.
